  <h2>About Briefer.pro</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Briefer.pro</strong> is a living library of practical instructions and a dynamic database of technical
    documentation.
    We are an intelligent environment where users and editors collaboratively create and improve content using built-in
    AI integration.
    Our goal is to build a self-growing ecosystem of practical knowledge, where content is strictly structured to ensure
    maximum clarity.

  <h2>How It Works: Content Generation and Knowledge Divergence</h2>
  <p>
    At the core of our platform is a unified article structure and a unique content creation mechanism, where artificial
    intelligence
    acts as an assistant in <strong>Knowledge Divergence</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Content Generation with AI Links</h3>
  <p>
    The platform uses an <strong>Article Generator</strong> component (card-based editor, or <em>CardEditor</em>),
    which allows users to create, edit, and preview articles directly in the browser.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Using the AI assistant:</strong> When a user creates a new article or edits an existing section (card),
      they can enter a prompt into the AI assistant input field.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automatic insertion of AI links:</strong> During content generation, the AI automatically inserts
      <code>&lt;ai-link&gt;</code> tags into the text where it identifies subtopics that are broad and complex and
      cannot
      be fully covered within the current unified guide.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Link structure:</strong> Each generated AI link is a special interactive marker that includes
      <code>topic</code> (the exact title of the new article) and <code>template</code>
      (a structure template identifier, for example <code>guide</code>).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Knowledge Divergence</h3>
  <p>
    AI links act as interactive elements that allow users to trigger AI-based generation of missing sub-articles
    directly from the text of the parent article.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Generation trigger:</strong> When a user (or guest) clicks an AI link within the text,
      this action initiates a request to generate new content.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Draft creation:</strong> The AI automatically generates a new article using the context of the parent
      article and the selected structural template. This article is immediately saved as a draft in the user’s profile.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Linking:</strong> After the draft is refined and approved by an administrator (moderator),
      it is published and linked back as a child article of the parent one. These relationships create
      “parent → child” article chains for navigation, forming a networked knowledge graph.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Through this cycle, AI helps users break down broad topics (for example, website creation, which includes
    programming and design) into a network of interconnected but more narrowly focused articles,
    while maintaining a strict unified structure for each one.

<section id="terms">
  <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    On our platform, any content saved to a user profile does not affect the public version without moderator approval.
    The AI agent assists in creating and improving content, but the Administrator reviews the content,
    adds external links, AI links, and glossary explanations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since AI alone cannot fully account for all the complexities of real-world projects,
    your contribution and experience are essential to ensure practical and relevant guidance.
