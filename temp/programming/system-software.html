        <h1>How to Make System Software Project: Example of How to Write Brief with Essential Free and Paid Tools and Basic Questions</h1>
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Overview of Project</h2>
        <p>Overview in a project brief for software development is a high-level description of the project's purpose and objectives. It sets the tone for the entire project and helps stakeholders understand the project's goals and vision. In this section, it is important to describe the methodology or framework that will be used to manage the project. Some of the popular frameworks for software development are Agile, SCRUM, Kanban, and Waterfall.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development. It emphasizes collaboration, customer satisfaction, and the ability to respond to change.</li>
            <li>SCRUM is a framework within Agile that emphasizes self-organizing teams, sprints, and daily stand-up meetings.</li>
            <li>Kanban is a visual framework that focuses on workflow management and limiting work in progress.</li>
            <li>Waterfall, on the other hand, is a sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another important aspect to consider is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP is the smallest set of features that can be released to the market and still provide value to the customer. Sprints are a common practice in Agile methodology where the development team works on a set of features in a short period of time, usually two weeks.</p>
        <p>Deadlines and releases are also important to consider. Deadlines set the expectation for when a feature or project will be completed. A release is when a new version of the software is made available to the public.</p>
        <p>Decomposition is the process of breaking down a project into smaller, manageable tasks. This process helps to identify dependencies and allows for better estimation of time and resources needed for each task.</p>
        <p>Retrospective and Sprint Review are important practices to consider in Agile methodology. Retrospectives allow the team to reflect on the previous sprint and identify areas for improvement. Sprint Review is a meeting where the team presents the completed work to stakeholders and receives feedback.</p>
        <p>Velocity, User Story, Story Point, WBS (work breakdown structure), Dependencies, Project Plan, Time and Material, Risk Management, and Risk Register are other important concepts to consider in the project brief for software development. Velocity is a measure of how much work the team can complete in a sprint. User stories are brief descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end-user. Story points are a measure of the complexity of a task. WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of tasks that need to be completed. Dependencies are tasks that must be completed before other tasks can begin. Project Plan is a roadmap that outlines the tasks, timelines, and milestones of the project. Time and Material is a pricing model where the client pays for the actual time and resources used for the project. Risk Management involves identifying and mitigating potential risks. A Risk Register is a document that tracks all potential risks and their mitigation plans.</p>
        <p>In summary, the overview section of a software development project brief should provide a clear understanding of the project's purpose and objectives. It should also include the methodology or framework that will be used to manage the project, project management tools, and key concepts such as MVP, sprints, deadlines, releases, decomposition, retrospective, sprint review, velocity, user stories, story points, WBS, dependencies, project plan, time and material, risk management, and risk register.</p>
