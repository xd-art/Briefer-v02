            "excerpt": "Elon Musk's radically angular Cybertruck pickup shocked audiences in 2019 with its geometric stainless steel body evoking sci-fi movies and 80s cars. Its unconventional form draws criticism along with praise for its boldly futuristic look. Behind the origami-esque styling lies a highly capable electric truck with armored doors, adaptive air suspension, and up to 500km range. But with pickup buyers traditionally loyal to brands like Ford and RAM, does the Cybertruck's divisive design represent an innovation that will disrupt and transform the market or an alienating bust?",

            "content": "<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 700; font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif; font-size: 60px;\">Tesla's Cybertruck <br> </span> Promises a Pickup Truck Design Revolution</h1><hr><br><p> In November 2019, Tesla founder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk\"> Elon Musk </a> unveiled the first pickup truck that his company will produce in Los Angeles. The unusual angular shape of the Cybertruck provoked thousands of jokes and memes; despite the barrage of criticism, Musk reported on November 26 that 250,000 people had pre-ordered the vehicle. </p><p>After several delays, the Tesla Cybertruck was finally released into production on November 30, 2023. It is offered in three models: Cyberbeast, All Wheel Drive, and Rear-Wheel Drive, with an EPA range of 250 to 340 miles (400-550 km) depending on the model.</p><p>One of the most noticeable aspects of the Cybertruck is its unique design. Made from stainless steel, it features sharp angles and straight lines, eliciting both positive and negative reviews. Some people consider it futuristic and bold, while others find it rugged and unappealing.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/tesla-cybertruck-design-elon-musk-1.png\" alt=\"\"/><h3>What makes Cybertruck unique</h3><p>In addition to its design, the Cybertruck offers a range of unique features that set it apart from other electric pickups. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Armored Doors</strong>: Cybertruck doors are made of 3mm thick stainless steel and can withstand shots from weapons up to 9mm. This makes it one of the safest pickups on the market.</li><li><strong>Adjustable Suspension</strong>: The Cybertruck is equipped with electronic adaptive suspension, allowing the adjustment of ground clearance from 8 to 16 inches. This provides versatility, allowing it to be used both off-road and on city streets.</li><li><strong>Smart Features</strong>: Cybertruck comes with a variety of smart features such as autopilot, parking assistance system, and facial recognition. These features make it one of the most technologically advanced pickups on the market.</li></ul><h2 >Form, equipment and materials of Elon Musk's super pickup</h2><p>\"The reason the Cybertruck is so rectangular is that you can't stamp <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Holzhausen\">ultra-hard 30X steel</a> otherwise it breaks the stamping press. Even bending it requires very clever soft geometry in the fold—that's why prototype is faceted,\" Elon Musk wrote on Twitter, explaining why the team that worked on creating the pickup chose this shape.</p><p>However, the public also had other questions regarding not only the exterior of the Cybertruck: for example, how good the car is in terms of aerodynamics. It turned out that it is no worse than other pickups in this parameter. To show how the angular shape of the car affects its speed and maneuverability, the authors of the YouTube channel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fuLD0R1iEU\">Boats and Engines</a> simulated the behavior of the vehicle using a special program. They concluded that the air resistance coefficient of this machine is lower than that of the popular <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/\">Ford F-150</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ramtrucks.com/ram-1500/\">Dodge Ram 1500</a> pickups (however, the coefficients obtained from the Boats and Engines simulation differ from the figures claimed by the manufacturers of the aforementioned vehicles). Another expert, aerospace engineer Justin Martin, also analyzed the aerodynamic properties of the Cybertruck using simulation and came to similar conclusions.</p><p>In any case, all these experiments are just fantasy for now. Currently, the Cybertruck is more of a pickup concept, far from being introduced to the market. The vehicle lacks important elements that are necessary for it to actually be drivable. The model shown at the presentation did not have side mirrors, wipers or additional clearance lights - all these elements are necessary to sell the car in the US (although federal authorities are considering introducing a new law that will allow the use of cameras instead of side mirrors).</p><p>Tesla representatives have not yet commented on whether the design and equipment of the vehicle will change before the company launches it into production in 2021.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/tesla-cybertruck-design-1.png\" alt=\"\"/><h2>A bold design offered to a conservative audience</h2><p>Matthew DeBord, senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the auto market and Tesla in particular, believes the Cybertruck is a real breakthrough for the company and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tesla.com/careers/people/franz-von-holzhausen\">Tesla’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen</a>.</p><p>Holzhausen joined Tesla in 2008, already being a well-known designer in the auto industry, and it was thanks to his efforts that the company managed to attract mass consumers. “[Tesla] Model S draws attention but does not demand it. For Holzhausen, this is a vision of the future that is clear to everyone,” DeBord wrote about Tesla’s first model released after the designer joined Musk’s startup. However, since 2012 Tesla has not released anything that could be called a design breakthrough - the Tesla Model X, Model 3 and Model Y models were a continuation of the direction set by the Model S.</p><p>The Cybertruck looks nothing like Tesla's previous models: its low-poly outlines are reminiscent of cars from science fiction movies and do not fit into the line of sleek sedans that Holzhausen created earlier.</p><p>What makes this pickup remarkable is that it offers bold styling to a conservative audience. <br><h3>\"No one can accuse the Cybertruck of being too grounded in the reality of the pickup truck market,\" </h3><br> DeBord comments. Dropbox Vice President of Product and Growth Adam Nash wrote: “I’m still not sure there’s overlap on a Venn diagram of ‘people who buy pickup trucks’ and ‘people who like the way this looks’ — but maybe that means they’re [Tesla] going to create a new market?”</p><p>If Tesla does try to reach the pickup truck buyer audience, the company will have to compete with market leaders whose customers are usually very loyal to their chosen brand: for example, Ford pickup buyers have a 70 percent chance of choosing the same brand when buying trucks again. According to Forbes estimates, the Cybertruck could bring Tesla over $4.5 billion in revenue by 2025; compared to market leader Ford, whose pickup truck revenue was about $25 billion in 2018, this is relatively small.</p><h2>Tesla drew inspiration from science fiction and the 1980s</h2><p>The Cybertruck is futuristic. Back in 2018, Musk told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher\">Kara Swisher</a>, a journalist, that the pickup would be inspired by the movie Blade Runner. And indeed, the outlines of the vehicle resemble the \"spinners\" - flying police cars from Ridley Scott's famous movie. Syd Mead, the art director of Blade Runner who came up with these fantastic machines, approves of the Cybertruck design: “It completely changes the design language of the pickup truck market.”</p><p>Another source of inspiration for Musk, Holzhausen and the entire Tesla team is the iconic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.halowaypoint.com/universe/vehicles/warthog\">Warthog jeep</a> from the popular Halo game series. Interestingly, just recently a Halo fan even recreated the cult vehicle based on a Chevrolet pickup! Obviously, the Cybertruck isn't a complete replica of the sci-fi machine, but the resemblance is strong enough to have caught the attention of game fans. For instance, famous YouTube blogger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie\">PewDiePie</a> even declared his intention to buy the car because of its Warthog vibes.</p><p>Shortly after the release of the Cybertruck, the famous Italian design studio <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.italdesign.it/\">ItalDesign</a> published photos of its old projects on Facebook with the caption: \"Icons never cease to inspire us. Maybe you recently noticed some echoes of this legacy?\" The ItalDesign studio is known for its \"wedge-shaped\" cars - cars of this shape began to appear in the 1960s and peaked in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s. This type of vehicle includes models such as the Alfa Romeo Carabo, Maserati Boomerang, BMW M1 and others.</p><p>One of the most striking examples of \"wedge-shaped\" design is the iconic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Esprit#Esprit_S1\">Lotus Esprit S1</a> car created by ItalDesign co-founder Giorgetto Giugiaro. This model became another important reference for the Cybertruck design team. Notably, Musk first encountered the Lotus Esprit S1 as a child while watching the 1977 spy comedy The Spy Who Loved Me, the tenth James Bond film. It seems this early exposure left a lasting impression!</p><p>In 2013, Musk even bought one of the cars used in filming for $997,000. At the time, he also talked about his impressions of the film: “When I was a child growing up in South Africa, I was amazed at how James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me drove his Lotus Esprit off a pier, pressed a button and it turned into a submarine underwater. I was disappointed to learn that it can’t actually transform. I’m going to make it so that an electric Tesla power train can enable cars to transform for real.\"</p><p>Although the Cybertruck will likely have to be modified for release in the US market, and Musk's plan to create a car-submarine has (so far) not materialized, many still see the Cybertruck as a revolution. Dave Chen, Adobe’s chief designer and former Tesla designer, tweeted: <h3>“Whether you love it or hate it, your outlook on pickups will never be the same. Every pickup on the planet now looks old fashioned and tired. It’s a lesson in taking creative risks, building something unexpected and making a statement.”</p></h3><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/tesla-cybertruck-design-2.png\" alt=\"\"/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, despite the controversial public reaction, the extremely bold and futuristic design of the Tesla Cybertruck promises to become a real revolution in the pickup truck market.</p><p>The Tesla Cybertruck is an uncompromising vehicle, extremely controversial in terms of design, yet potentially revolutionary in terms of its technical characteristics and functionality.</p><p>The radical, overtly futuristic look of the Cybertruck came as a surprise to many and will likely remain a subject of discussion for a long time. But Elon Musk notes that innovation lies precisely in the audacity to offer something fundamentally different from traditional pickup trucks.</p><p>Even skeptics admit that behind the Cybertruck's unusual exterior lies outstanding functionality: a 1,900 kg payload capacity, 950 km range, 209 km/h top speed and a 2.9 second 0-100 km/h acceleration time. These are strong arguments for professionals. In addition, the rugged body and 3 mm steel doors provide safety.</p><p>Finally, the Cybertruck has a price advantage over its competitors, and electric propulsion is more economical than gasoline. All of this suggests that despite its appearance, this pickup will occupy an important place in the utility vehicle market and change notions of what makes a practical pickup, combining excellent working qualities and advanced technologies.</p>"

Experiments using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\" target=\"_blank\">functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</a> have shown that seeing a desired product activates the so-called \"pleasure center\" in the brain. This is the area of the brain responsible for rewards and satisfaction. The stronger the pleasure center is activated by the product, the more we want it.</p><p>However, when we see the price for the same product, a completely different area is activated in the brain - the \"suffering center.\" It is responsible for negative sensations and pain. Essentially, our brain interprets the price as suffering from having to part with money. It is the ratio between the activity of the pleasure center and the suffering center that ultimately determines whether a purchase will be made or not. If pleasure outweighs the pain of the price - we are more likely to buy the product.</p><p>Thus, studying the activity of different brain areas gives us an understanding of how our purchasing decisions are made at the deepest level. This knowledge can be used for more effective marketing and advertising.</p><div style=\"padding-right: 10px; float:left;\"><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\"> Endowment <br> Effect </h2></div><p>By examining other research in behavioral economics, an interesting relationship was found between the described mechanism of making purchasing decisions and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect\" target=\"_blank\">endowment effect</a>. There are interesting parallels between the endowment effect and how the brain makes purchasing decisions based on the ratio of pleasure and suffering.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/Pleasure-vs-Sufferin.png\" alt=\"\"><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Endowment Effect and the Suffering Center</h2><p>The endowment effect is that people place greater value on what they already have compared to what they don't have. We don't want to lose what we consider ours. This resonates with the activation of the \"suffering center\" when seeing the price of a product.</p><p>At a subconscious level, we associate the price with suffering from losing money that is already our property. The higher the price, the more the suffering center is activated. At the same time, the endowment effect can enhance the activity of the \"pleasure center\" from the product itself.</p><p>If this product is already our property, we get additional pleasure from owning it. Thus, the endowment effect increases the gap between pleasure from the product and suffering from the price. This makes us more likely to keep the product rather than part with it.</p><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Diminishing Marginal Utility of Wealth</h2><p>In addition, there is another economic effect that also resonates with the described brain activity in making purchasing decisions. This is the effect of diminishing marginal utility of wealth.</p><p>The diminishing marginal utility of wealth can indeed be juxtaposed with how the brain reacts to price when making purchasing decisions. In both cases, a similar pattern is observed.</p><p>As wealth increases, the utility of each subsequent unit (dollar, euro, etc.) decreases - this is the diminishing marginal utility. Similarly, as fMRI experiments showed, as the price of a product increases, the activity of the \"suffering center\" in the brain intensifies, but each subsequent price increase causes a smaller increase in the activity of this center.</p><p>That is, the marginal suffering from the price also diminishes. A difference of $10 bothers us more when the price of a product is $50 vs $60 than when it is $500 vs $510. This similarity is not accidental. In both cases, the Weber-Fechner psychophysical law applies: human sensations are proportional to the logarithm of the actual stimulus.</p><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Key Factors Influencing Purchase Decisions</h2><p>Summarizing the results of all the studies considered, the following conclusions can be drawn about the key factors influencing the purchase decision:</p><ul><li>Pleasure from the product (activates the \"pleasure center\")</li><li>Suffering from the price (activates the \"suffering center\")</li><li>Endowment effect (enhances pleasure of ownership and suffering of loss)</li><li>Diminishing marginal utility and diminishing marginal suffering</li></ul><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Implications for Marketing</h2><p>Neuromarketing research allows us to better understand the nature of these factors and their influence on purchase decisions. This knowledge provides new opportunities for more effective marketing and stimulating demand.</p><p>For example, companies can enhance pleasure from the product through branding and positioning. Reduce suffering from the price through discounts and installments. Use the endowment effect by offering bonuses to loyal customers.</p><p>Thus, a deep understanding of how the brain works and the influence of various economic effects allows companies to build a more effective marketing strategy based on stimulating the irrational motives of the buyer. This provides a significant competitive advantage and leads to increased sales.</p>"

            "image": "/images/pictures/blog/blue-ocean.png",
            "content": "<h1 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Charting a Course to Blue Ocean Strategy</h1><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><h2>Guy Laliberté: From Street Performer to Head of Cirque du Soleil</h2><p>Guy Laliberté, a former accordionist, acrobat, and fire-eater, is now the head of Cirque du Soleil, one of Canada's largest cultural export companies. Founded in 1984 by a group of street performers, the company has already introduced its productions to nearly forty million people in ninety cities around the world. In less than twenty years of its existence, Cirque du Soleil began to receive the kind of profits that Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey - the world champions of the circus industry - managed to achieve only after more than a hundred years after their appearance. This rapid growth is also remarkable in that it occurred not in an attractive, but in a fading industry, where a traditional strategic analysis indicated limited growth opportunities.</p><img style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/blue-ocean.png\" alt=\"\"><h2>Creating a New Market Segment</h2><p>Another interesting aspect of Cirque du Soleil's success was that the company did not win by poaching customers from the declining circus industry, which was historically focused on children. Cirque du Soleil did not compete with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Instead, the company created a new, untapped market segment, free of competitors. It targeted an entirely new group of consumers: adults and corporate clients willing to pay several times more than a regular circus ticket to see a new, unprecedented show. The name of one of Cirque du Soleil's first projects spoke for itself: \"We are reinventing the circus from scratch.\"</p><h2>Blue Oceans vs. Red Oceans</h2><p>Cirque du Soleil succeeded because it understood that in order to win in the future, companies should stop competing with each other. The only way to beat the competition is to stop trying to beat it. To understand what Cirque du Soleil achieved, imagine a market universe consisting of two oceans: red and blue. The red oceans symbolize all existing industries at the moment. This is the known part of the market. Blue oceans denote all industries that do not yet exist today. These are unknown areas of the market.</p><p>In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and agreed upon, and the rules of the competition game are known to all. Here, companies seek to outperform their rivals in order to attract a greater share of existing demand. As the market becomes more and more crowded, the chances for growth and profit making keep falling. Products become commodities, and ruthless competitors cut each other’s throats, turning the red ocean blood red.</p><p>In contrast, blue oceans denote untouched market areas which demand creative approaches and offer opportunities for growth and high profits. Although some blue oceans emerge beyond the established industry boundaries, most blue oceans emerge within red oceans by expanding the existing industry boundaries, as Cirque du Soleil did. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game have yet to be set.</p><h2>Creating Blue Oceans</h2><p>Cirque du Soleil succeeded because it understood that in order to win in the future, companies should stop competing with each other. The only way to beat the competition is to stop trying to beat it. This book offers you practical patterns and analytical tools for systematically finding and capturing blue oceans. Unfortunately, blue ocean maps are almost non-existent. All major developments in strategic thinking over the past twenty-five years have focused mainly on competition-based red ocean strategies. As a result, we know a lot about battling competitors in red waters, from analyzing the underlying economic structure of an industry and choosing strategic positions - low cost, differentiation, or focus - to benchmarking competitors. Debates on blue oceans continue without interruption. However, there is very little practical guidance on how to create such oceans.</p><h2>The Evolution of Industries</h2><p>Blue oceans have always been created. Although the term blue oceans is quite new, the same cannot be said about the oceans themselves. They are an integral part of the business world of the past and present. Look at the world a hundred years ago and ask yourself: how many of today's industries were completely unknown back then? The answer is that such fundamental industries as automotive, sound recording, aviation, oil refining, healthcare, and management consulting were either unheard of or just beginning to emerge at best.</p><p>Fast forward just thirty years. Again, you can list dozens of multibillion-dollar industries such as mutual funds, mobile phones, gas power plants, biotechnology, retail discounters, express couriers, minivans, snowboards, coffee bars, and home video recorders - and that's far from all of them. Just three decades ago, not one of these industries really existed. Now let’s move the clock forward twenty or fifty years and ask ourselves: How many still unknown industries will there be then? If history is any predictor of the future, the answer is many.</p><p>The truth is industries have never been static. They continuously evolve. Their performance improves, markets expand, and players come and go. History makes it clear that we have seriously underestimated the possibility of creating new industries and re-creating existing ones. However, strategic thinking still focuses mainly on red ocean strategies related to competition.</p><h2>Quantifying the Impact of Blue Oceans on Profit and Revenue</h2><p>In the course of studying the business initiatives of 108 organizations, we tried to quantify the impact of blue oceans on profit and revenue (Fig. 1.1). It turned out that 86% of initiatives represented a linear expansion, that is, they involved gradual improvements in the existing market space - within the red oceans. They accounted for only 62% of total revenue and 39% of total profit.</p><p>The remaining 14% of initiatives were aimed at creating blue oceans. They generated 38 and 61%, respectively. Given that business initiatives included all investments in creating red and blue oceans (regardless of the size of the revenues and profits they generate, including completely failed projects), the benefits of creating a blue ocean are obvious. And although we do not have data on the success rate of initiatives in red and blue oceans, the above overall differences in their effectiveness speak for themselves.</p><h2>Fig. 1.1. The impact of creating a blue ocean on growth and profit</h2><img style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/blue-ocean-1.png\" alt=\"The impact of creating a blue ocean on growth and profit\"><h2>The Growing Need to Create Blue Oceans</h2><p>Behind the growing need to create blue oceans lies a number of driving forces. Technological advances have greatly increased production efficiency and allowed suppliers to produce unprecedented volumes of products and services. As a result, supply exceeds demand in many industries. Globalization exacerbates the situation. As national and regional borders fade and information about products and prices spreads instantly around the world, niche markets and monopolistic domains continue to disappear. Supply is increasing due to global competition, but there is no evidence of increasing demand worldwide, and statistics even point to declining numbers of participants in many developed markets. The result has been an ever-increasing commoditization of goods and services, more severe price wars, and declining profits.</p><p>Recent research on major American brands within an industry confirmed this trend. According to the research, brands in major product and service categories are becoming more and more similar, and as they become more similar, people are increasingly making their choice based on price. Unlike the past, the consumer is no longer willing to wash only with \"Tide.\" And he will not cling to \"Colgate\" if \"Crest\" toothpaste is on sale at discounted prices, and vice versa. In areas crowded with manufacturers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between brands in both economic upturns and downturns. All this means that the business environment that gave rise to most strategic and managerial approaches in the 20th century is gradually disappearing. More and more blood is being spilled in the red oceans, and managers need to pay more attention to the blue oceans than the hordes of current managers are used to.</p><h2>From Company and Industry to Strategic Move</h2><p>How can a company break out of the red ocean of fierce competition? How can it create a blue ocean? Is there a systematic approach that can ensure that a company achieves this goal and thus maintains high performance? When we started looking for answers, our first step was to define the basic unit of analysis for our research. To understand where high performance comes from, the company is usually used as the main unit of analysis in business literature. People do not cease to admire how companies achieve significant growth and profitability rates, having an exquisite set of strategic, operational and organizational characteristics.</p><p>However, we asked a different question: are there any \"exceptional\" or \"visionary\" long-lived companies that constantly outplay the market and create blue oceans over and over again? Take, for example, the books \"In Search of Excellence\" and \"Built to Last.\" The bestseller \"In Search of Excellence\" was published twenty years ago. However, two years after its publication, some of the companies studied by the author - Atari, Cheseborough-Pond's, Data General, Fluor, National Semiconductor - faded into oblivion. As stated in Managing on the Edge, two-thirds of the exemplary companies listed in the book lost their industry leadership position within five years of the book's publication. The book \"Built to Last\" continued the same theme. In it, the author sought to identify the \"success habits of visionary companies\" that had long experience of high performance. However, to avoid the mistakes made in \"In Search of Excellence\", the research period in \"Built to Last\" was expanded to the size of the company's life cycle, and only companies that had existed for at least forty years were analyzed. \"Built to Last\" also became a bestseller. However, upon close examination, some flaws emerged in the supposedly visionary companies examined in the book.</p><p>As shown in \"Creative Destruction,\" much of the success that the author of \"Built to Last\" attributed to exemplary companies was more the result of the industry as a whole rather than the fruits of the companies themselves. For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) met the criteria set out in \"Built to Last\" because it had long been ahead of the entire market. In practice, the entire computer components industry was ahead of the entire market along with HP. Moreover, HP did not even surpass all of its competitors within that industry. Noting this and other examples, the authors of \"Creative Destruction\" wondered if there were ever any truly \"visionary\" companies that had long been ahead of the entire market.</p><img style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/blue-ocean-2.png\" alt=\" blue ocean vs red ocean \"><h2>The Strategic Move: Key to Blue Oceans and High Performance</h2><p>In addition, we all had the opportunity to observe the stagnation or decline of Japanese companies, which at the height of their heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s were renowned as revolutionary strategists. If there are no eternally high-performing companies and if the same company goes from unprecedented success to decline, it turns out that the company cannot be considered a suitable unit of analysis in studying the sources of high performance and blue oceans.</p><p>As mentioned above, history also shows that industries have never ceased to emerge and expand and that industry conditions and boundaries are not constant; they are set by individual entities. Companies do not need to butt heads in the space of an industry; Cirque du Soleil created a new market space in the entertainment sector and, as a result, achieved powerful profit growth. It turns out that neither the company nor the industry can be considered the optimal unit of analysis for studying the sources of profitable growth.</p><p>In full accordance with this, our research showed that it is the \"strategic move\" - not the \"company\" or \"industry\" - that is the appropriate unit for explaining the creation of blue oceans and the permanent high performance of companies. A strategic move is a set of actions and decisions by management to develop a major business offer that opens up a new market. For example, in 2001 Compaq was acquired by Hewlett-Packard and lost its independence. As a result, many labeled the company as a failure. However, this did not devalue Compaq's blue ocean-focused strategic move to shape the server industry. These strategic moves not only became part of the company's powerful return to the market in the mid-1990s but also paved the way for a new multi-billion dollar market in computer hardware manufacturing.</p><p>Appendix A, \"A Historical Overview of the Blue Ocean Creation Pattern,\" provides a condensed history of three quintessentially American industries, based on our database: the automotive industry - how we get to work; the computer industry - what we use at work; the film industry - where we go to entertain ourselves after work. As shown in Appendix A, there are no consistently successful companies or industries. However, the strategic moves that led to the creation of blue oceans and new trajectories of powerful profit growth are strikingly similar.</p><p>The strategic moves we are talking about - moves to create products and services that opened up and conquered new market spaces with sharply increased demand - are exciting stories of profitable growth, stories that make you think about the opportunities missed by those companies stuck in red oceans. We built our research around these strategic moves to understand how blue oceans are created and high business performance is achieved. We studied over one hundred and fifty strategic moves made between 1880 and 2000 in more than thirty industries and meticulously examined the business players involved in each of these events. The industries were extremely diverse: from hotels, film, retail, air travel, energy, computers, broadcasting and construction to automotive and steel.</p><p>We analyzed not only the winners who managed to create blue oceans, but also their less successful competitors. Both within each specific strategic move and across all strategic moves, we looked for similarities within the blue ocean creator group and among the less fortunate players stuck in the red ocean. We also looked for differences between these two groups. In the process, we tried to identify the common factors that led to the creation of blue oceans, as well as the key characteristics that distinguish the winners from the mere \"survivors\" and failures adrift in the red ocean.</p><p>As a result, after studying more than thirty industries, we found that neither industry characteristics nor organizational characteristics can explain the differences between these two groups. In assessing variable industry, organizational and strategy characteristics, we found that small and large companies succeeded in creating and capturing blue oceans, as did young and old managers, companies from attractive and unattractive industries, newcomers and dinosaurs, private and state-owned companies, representatives of low-tech and high-tech industries, as well as companies of very diverse national origins. Our analysis did not reveal a single permanently flawless company or industry. However, behind the seeming variety of success stories, we still managed to find a consistent and universal set of strategic moves to create and capture blue oceans.</p><p>Whether it was Ford in 1908 with its Model T; GM, which launched elegant emotionally appealing cars in 1924; CNN, which offered real-time twenty-four hour seven day a week news in 1980; or Compaq, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines or Cirque du Soleil, any other blue ocean cases we studied in our research, the approach to blue ocean strategy was always similar, regardless of industry.</p><p>Our research also covered famous strategic moves that led to radical changes in the public sector. And here too we discovered an amazingly similar pattern of action.</p><h2>Revolutionizing the Circus Industry</h2><p>Just as when the circus industry engaged in star wars, the so-called stars of the circus were pale in comparison to movie stars in the minds of viewers. And again, this tactic was very costly and had practically no impact on the audience. The idea of three rings also faded away. Such shows not only created tension for viewers forced to quickly shift their gaze from one ring to another, but also required a larger number of performers, leading to higher costs. Renting out premises for retail outlets and selling goods between rows seemed like a good way to make a profit, but in practice it turned out that the inflated prices kept viewers from making purchases and left them feeling cheated.</p><h2>The Essence of Circus Appeal</h2><p>All the perennial appeal of the circus boiled down to three main factors: the big top, clowns, and classic circus acts of various kinds of acrobatics and unicycling. Therefore, Cirque du Soleil retained clowns, but their humor became more subtle and refined rather than vulgar. The big top was refined, yet it was the big top that, ironically, many circuses had abandoned in favor of renting venues.</p><h2>Revitalizing the Big Top Symbolism</h2><p>Seeing that the big top alone was the symbol that embodied the magic of the circus, Cirque du Soleil created a classic circus symbol distinguished by its magnificent exterior finish and increased comfort. Such tents evoked thoughts of the great and legendary circuses. Sawdust and hard benches were removed. The acrobatic and other breathtaking acts remained but began to play a smaller role. They were made more elegant with an artistic flair and intellectual component added.</p><h2>Infusion of Theatrical Elements</h2><p>Looking into the market territory of theater, Cirque du Soleil also introduced new non-circus elements such as a plot line and with it the intellectual richness, artistic music and dance, and diversity of performances. By incorporating all these components, which were an innovation in the circus industry, into its program, Cirque du Soleil managed to create more sophisticated performances. Moreover, by introducing the concept of a variety of performances and thus giving people a reason to go to the circus more often, Cirque du Soleil significantly increased existing demand.</p><h2>An Unprecedented Value Proposition</h2><p>In summary, Cirque du Soleil offers the best of circus and theater, while minimizing or eliminating everything else. Thanks to this unprecedented value proposition, Cirque du Soleil created a blue ocean and invented a new kind of live entertainment that was markedly distinct from both the traditional circus and the traditional theater. At the same time, by abandoning many of the most expensive components of the circus, the company managed to sharply reduce its costs, thereby achieving both differentiation and low costs simultaneously. Cirque du Soleil took a strategic step by bringing its ticket prices closer to those of the theater. Ticket prices were several times higher than the level accepted in the circus industry, but they were attractive to adult viewers accustomed to theater ticket prices.</p><h2>The Dwindling Impact of Circus Stars</h2><p>Similarly, when the circus industry started inviting stars, the so-called circus stars seemed quite insignificant compared to movie stars in the minds of viewers. And again, this tactic required major expenses and had practically no impact on the audience. The idea of three rings also faded away. Such shows not only created tension for viewers forced to quickly shift their gaze from one ring to another, but also required more performers, leading to higher costs. Renting out premises for retail outlets and selling goods between rows seemed like a good way to make a profit, but in practice it turned out that the inflated prices kept viewers from making purchases and left them feeling cheated.</p><h2>The Essence of Circus Appeal: Big Tops, Clowns, and Classic Acts</h2><p>All the perennial appeal of the circus boiled down to three main factors: the big top, clowns, and classic circus acts of various kinds of acrobatics and unicycling. Therefore, Cirque du Soleil retained clowns, but their humor became more subtle and refined rather than vulgar. The big top was refined, yet it was the big top that, ironically, many circuses had abandoned in favor of renting venues. Seeing that the big top alone was the symbol that embodied the magic of the circus, Cirque du Soleil created a classic circus symbol distinguished by its magnificent exterior finish and increased comfort. Such tents evoked thoughts of the great and legendary circuses. Sawdust and hard benches were removed.</p><h2>Evolution of Circus Acts: Elegance, Artistry, and Intellectual Components</h2><p>The acrobatic and other breathtaking acts remained but began to play a smaller role. They were made more elegant with an artistic flair and intellectual component added. Looking into the market territory of theater, Cirque du Soleil also introduced new non-circus elements such as a plot line and with it the intellectual richness, artistic music and dance, and diversity of performances. All these elements, which were an innovation in the circus industry, were taken from the alternative live entertainment industry - the theater business. For example, if in traditional circuses the acts are just a series of performances unrelated to each other, then each Cirque du Soleil creation, on the contrary, had a theme and plot, thereby resembling a theatrical performance to some extent. Although the theme was set vaguely (this was done deliberately), it brought harmony and an element of intellect to the show without limiting the number of circus acts themselves.</p><h2>Borrowing from Broadway: Variety, Music, and Dance</h2><p>In addition, Cirque du Soleil borrowed some ideas from Broadway shows. For example, it presents a variety of programs and productions, not traditional “one size fits all” shows. Again, following the example of Broadway shows, each Cirque du Soleil performance has appropriate musical accompaniment that governs (rather than overrides) the visual component, lighting and duration of each performance. The program also includes beautiful dances - the idea was taken from theater and ballet. By incorporating all these components into its program, Cirque du Soleil managed to create more sophisticated performances. Moreover, by introducing the concept of a variety of productions and thus giving people a reason to go to the circus more often, Cirque du Soleil significantly increased existing demand.</p><h2>Summary: Cirque du Soleil's Unprecedented Value Proposition</h2><p>In summary, Cirque du Soleil offers the best circus and theater has to offer, while minimizing or eliminating everything else.

Cirque du Soleil took a strategic step by bringing its ticket prices closer to those of the theater. Ticket prices were several times higher than the level accepted in the circus industry, but they were attractive to adult viewers accustomed to theater ticket prices.</p><h2>Developing and Executing a Blue Ocean Strategy</h2><p>Although economic conditions indicate an increasing need to create blue oceans, there is a persistent belief that the chances of success decrease when a company goes beyond the existing industry space in its activities. How to succeed in blue oceans? What should companies do to maximize opportunities while minimizing the risks associated with developing and implementing a blue ocean strategy? If you do not have a good enough understanding of the principles of expanding opportunities and minimizing risks that underlie the creation and conquest of blue oceans, your chances of failure in creating a blue ocean will be high.</p><p>Of course, there is no such thing as a risk-free strategy. Strategy always involves opportunities and risks - regardless of whether events occur in a red or blue ocean. However, at present, the balance on the playing field is disrupted in favor of tools and analytical frameworks designed to succeed in red oceans. Until this changes, red oceans will continue to prevail in a company's strategic plans, even if the imperative to create blue oceans becomes even more obvious. Perhaps this is why, despite repeated calls for companies to move beyond the existing industry space, they have not taken any serious steps in this direction.</p><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\"><tr><th style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px; background-color: #f2f2f2;\">Development Principles</th><th style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px; background-color: #f2f2f2;\">Risk Factor for Each Principle</th></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Reconstruct Market Boundaries</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Search Risk</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Focus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Planning Risk</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Go Beyond Existing Demand</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Scale Risk</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Define the Strategic Sequence Correctly</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Business Model Risk</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\"><b>Principles of Implementation</b> </td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\"><b> Risk Factor for Each Principle</b></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Overcome Key Organizational Barriers</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Organizational Risk</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Embed Implementation in Strategy</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd; text-align: left; padding: 8px;\">Management Risk</td></tr></table><span class=\"--gray\"><p><b> Source:</b> Blue Ocean Strategy is a book published in 2004 written by W.

Of course, to YouTube. No one will argue that the face of the World Wide Web has changed dramatically over the years of the YouTube Internet platform's existence. Who created this unique creation? When and how did the YouTube Internet service, which gathers over 2 billion users in front of screens per month, originate? Briefer.pro tells the story of YouTube - from its appearance to the most popular channels of the video hosting.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/youtube-story.png\" alt=\"\"><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">YouTube History</h2><p> <b> The background of YouTube's creation</b></p><p>Today, the world's largest video hosting is used by over a billion people, which is almost half the number of all Internet users worldwide, and 80% of them have their own account on this service. Did the creators of YouTube know that their brainchild would hold viewers' attention for hours and eventually become the main platform for watching video content, with only Google ahead?</p><p>But few people know that the original idea of ​​YouTube's creators was a dating site. Moreover, it had its own twist - the user could not only meet but also upload their own videos to the profile. It was thanks to this twist that YouTube's further history was predetermined.</p><p>The dating service launched on the symbolic date - Valentine's Day in 2005. This is the date of the beginning of YouTube's history: the trademark was also registered then, as well as the logo and domain. But users, instead of uploading videos about themselves for dating, began to record video content mostly about what was happening around them and share videos.</p><p>It should be noted that before the appearance of this site, there were certain inconveniences with sending video content: email was used (with its small capacity for video files), it was not possible to view videos in real time, you had to wait a long time for the video to upload, and there was no guarantee that the video would be 100% viewable (unstable connection, coding difficulties).</p><p>The creators of YouTube took into account all these shortcomings, took Flash Video technology as the basis (it allowed maintaining good recording quality and upload speed with a small amount of data) and, without knowing it themselves, created a future Internet giant. Because people needed it. Because it was on time. But who created this popular site and where was YouTube created?</p><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Who Created YouTube</h2><p>YouTube creators are three young guys from the so-called PayPal mafia: Chad Hurley (was PayPal's chief designer), Jawed Karim (was PayPal's anti-fraud system developer), Steve Chen - computer engineer. After eBay bought the PayPal company, Steve and Jawed got rich and wanted to create their own project.</p><p>A little background on YouTube's creators:</p><ul><li><strong>Chad Meredith Hurley.</strong> Born in 1977. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania. As a child, Chad was fond of drawing, in high school he immersed himself in the field of IT technologies. He graduated from the College of Visual Arts. Created the first PayPal logo, after which he was hired there.</li><li><strong>Steven Chen.</strong> Born in 1978. Born in Taiwan, where he graduated from National University, then moved to America, where he graduated from the School of Mathematics, then successfully graduated from the largest campus of the University of Illinois. After studying, he also worked at PayPal. At the time of creating YouTube, he had experience owning his own company (Chen Systems, a supercomputer manufacturing company he sold in 1996).</li><li><strong>Jawed Karim.</strong> Born 1979. Born in GDR, then moved with his family to FRG, and at the age of 13 - to the USA. He graduated from Central School in Minnesota, enrolled at the same University of Illinois, but did not complete his studies, got a job at PayPal. His parents are scientists. Even while in high school, the guy became the creator of an autonomous electronic messaging system.</li></ul><p>The idea of ​​creating a video hosting allegedly belonged to Jawed Karim. It came up after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which caused a tsunami. Jawed wanted to find video of this event on the Internet but didn't find any. Then he voiced his idea of ​​creating a hosting for videos on any topic to his friends. It turned out that his friends were also enthusiastic about the idea of ​​creating something similar. They failed to send a video from one of the parties to their friends, which led to the idea of ​​creating such a service.</p><p>But the idea of ​​creating a hosting for videos on any topic seemed too abstract to the guys, so it was decided to launch the service as a dating site, which were gaining popularity in those years. This is how YouTube's history began.</p><p>In general, there are different versions regarding the idea of ​​creating video hosting. We will not insist on any of them. Users no longer care so much about who exactly owns the idea. In the end, the guys worked together, and we enjoy using their brainchild with pleasure.</p><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">YouTube Creation</h2><p><b>Where YouTube Was Created and the History of the First Video</b></p><p>YouTube's history began in San Bruno, California, where its creators lived. The company was also registered here. Initially, the platform had a non-commercial basis. But when the number of users began to reach 9 million per day, Hurley placed the first ad. But let's go back to the launch and development of the project.</p><p>The history of videos on the YouTube platform began with the first uploaded video. At that time, its duration should not have exceeded 10 minutes. Jawed uploads the first video, recording his trip to the zoo. It was posted on April 23, 2005, and lasted only 18-20 seconds. Then other users began posting similar videos and sharing them.</p><p>The guys understand that people need the resource for far more than just dating, and change the concept. But in the summer of 2005, it was still difficult to predict the future of the service, and Jawed leaves the company to complete his graduate studies at Stanford University.</p><p>But already in the fall, the guys attract serious investors and receive $3.5 million for development. Just a year after the launch of the project, thanks to various uploaded videos, YouTube enters world history as the most popular resource.</p><p>In 2006, with the platform showing the highest growth among all sites, it receives another $8 million in investment. The service already has over 65 thousand uploaded videos, and views exceed 100 million per day.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/youtube-story-2.png\" alt=\"\"><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Cooperation with Google in YouTube's History</h2><p>Those who created YouTube, these young guys, in 2005 could not even imagine that by the end of next summer they would be signing contracts with various major companies. What can we say about the main deal in their life - with Google Inc. The company thought very little about buying the video hosting. Already in September 2006, it offered the platform developers $1.6 billion for their brainchild.</p><p>The young people simply could not refuse such a deal and in November signed a contract, selling the video hosting to the corporation. After the deal, the newly enriched Steve Chen leaves his company, and Chad Hurley remains CEO for four years. In 2010, he will resign.</p><p>Since the purchase, Google has improved the service, and in 2007 introduced a unique program allowing users to monetize their video content. The era of YouTube bloggers began. Channels for children have become especially popular. Many people of different ages have become rich thanks to this platform. Here are just some of them:</p><h2 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">YouTube Stories</h2><ul><li>Jimmy Donaldson, 23 years old - $24 million.</li><li>Rett James McLaughlin, Charles Lincoln Neal at the age of 43 earned $10 million each.</li><li>Mark Edward Fischbach, 32 years old - $19.5 million.</li><li>Preston Arsement, 27 years old - $19 million.</li><li>Anastasia Radzinskaya earned over $18 million at the age of seven.</li><li>Stevin John, 33 years old - $17 million.</li></ul><p>Today, YouTube is the largest video hosting site in the world. It allows you to entertain yourself, learn, advertise your business, and, of course, monetize your personal content. Many have already completely forgotten about traditional television. Its channels on the beloved YouTube have completely swept it away. Over 2 billion users are on YouTube every month and cannot take their eyes off, watching one video after another. Do you watch videos on YouTube?</p>"

Tegmark points out the complexity of each of these components and argues that to safely create a superintelligent AI, solutions to this multifaceted problem must be found in advance, before its emergence.</p><p>What follows is Tegmark's opinion on this issue. It gives an idea of the depth of the problems arising on the path to creating friendly and safe artificial intelligence.</p><h2>The Challenge of Aligning Goals</h2><p>As machines become smarter and more powerful, it becomes increasingly important that their goals do not conflict with ours. Currently, the machines we build are somewhat dull, and the question is not whether human goals will ultimately prevail, but how much trouble these machines will cause humanity before we align their goals with ours. However, if superintelligent artificial intelligence ever emerges, the roles will reverse. Since intelligence is the ability to achieve goals, artificial superintelligence, by definition, is much better at achieving its goals than humans are at achieving theirs. Hence, its goals will ultimately prevail over ours.</p><h2>The Ingenuity of Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>If you want to experience what it feels like when a machine stands in your way, simply download the cutting-edge chess simulator and try to compete with it. You will never win, and it quickly brings in others to replace it. In other words, the real danger of artificial intelligence lies not in its malevolence but in its ingenuity. A superintelligent artificial intelligence will effectively pursue its goals, and if its goals conflict with ours, we will be in a precarious position.</p><h2>The Importance of Friendly AI</h2><p>Most researchers believe that if we ever create superintelligence, we must ensure that it is \"friendly,\" in the words of one of the creators of the theoretical approach to artificial intelligence safety, Eliezer Yudkowsky. This means that its goals should not contradict ours. Understanding how to align the goals of superintelligent artificial intelligence with ours is not only important but also challenging. In fact, it is an unsolved problem at the moment, divided into three challenging sub-problems actively studied by computer scientists and researchers from other fields.</p><h3>The Three Sub-Problems</h3><p> <b> These sub-problems include:</b></p><ol><li>Getting artificial intelligence to understand our goals</li><li>Getting artificial intelligence to adopt our goals</li><li>Getting artificial intelligence to adhere to our goals</li></ol><p>Let's delve into each sub-problem, deferring the question of what is meant by \"our goals\" to the next section.</p><br><br><section><div class=\"card-large\"><a href=\"/pages/programming/artificial-intelligence.php\"><h2> How to make AI</h2></a><span class=\"--gray\">By Pop Art Studio | 02.01.2022</span><p style=\"font-size: 1ppx;\"><br>This guide offers a start-to-finish framework for creating an artificial intelligence project. It covers defining goals, choosing AI types and programming languages, selecting development platforms, crafting smart algorithms, putting together a solid project brief, and outlining technical specifications for developers including system architecture, data ingestion, model training procedures, scalability features, security controls, testing protocols and documentation standards. Following this comprehensive blueprint helps set up an AI project for effective development and long-term success.</p></div></section><h2>Understanding Human Goals</h2><p>To understand our goals, artificial intelligence must understand not only what we do but why we do it. For humans, this is so natural that we often forget how difficult it is to explain to a computer and how easily our intentions can be misinterpreted. For example, if you ask a future self-driving car to get you to the airport \"as fast as possible\" and it takes it literally, you may end up at the airport covered in vomit and pursued by helicopters.</p><h3>Modeling Human Behavior</h3><p>This theme is not new and has appeared in history before. In the ancient Greek legend, King Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold and was dismayed when it led to not being able to eat and, more tragically, turning his daughter into a golden statue. In stories where a genie grants three wishes, there are many variations of the first two, but the third wish is almost always the same: \"Please undo the previous two because that's not what I really wanted.\" All these examples show that to understand what people really want, you cannot simply follow what they say. You also need a fairly detailed model of the world that includes some common assumptions that we usually do not talk about because we consider them obvious.</p><h2>The Challenge of Encoding Goals</h2><p>When such a model of the world exists, we can, in most cases, understand what people want, even if they do not communicate it - just by observing their purposeful behavior. In fact, children will learn more by observing their parents' behavior than by listening to what their parents tell them. Researchers in artificial intelligence are currently trying to teach machines to distinguish goals from behavior, and this will be a useful skill long before superintelligence emerges. For example, it would be helpful for an elderly person if a caregiving robot could understand what this person values simply by observing them, without the need for verbal explanations or programming.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/max-tegmark-4.png\" alt=\"\"><h2>The Role of Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>One difficulty is finding a good way to encode arbitrary systems of goals and ethical principles in a computer. Another challenge is creating a machine that can determine which systems are best suited to the observed behavior. The approach gaining popularity recently to tackle the second challenge is known in geek slang as reinforcement learning, and it is under close scrutiny at the new Berkeley Research Center created by Stuart Russell.</p><h3>Observing and Learning from Behavior</h3><p>Let's assume, for example, that artificial intelligence observes a woman - a member of a firefighting team - rushing into a burning building to save a baby. The machine may assume that her goal was to rescue the child and that her ethical principles compel her to value the life of the child significantly more than the comfort of leisure in the fire truck - she indeed values a stranger's life enough to risk her own safety for its rescue. However, artificial intelligence may also conclude that the firefighter was freezing and wanted to warm up or that she was engaging in a sport. If artificial intelligence is encountering fires for the first time and knows nothing about firefighters, fires, and babies, it would be difficult for it to understand which of the two explanations is correct.</p><h3>Hope in Continuous Decision-Making</h3><p>However, the fundamental idea of reinforcement learning is that we make decisions continuously, and each decision we make says something about our goals. Thus, there is hope that by observing a large number of people in different situations (real or in movies and literature), artificial intelligence will eventually build an accurate model of our common assumptions.</p><h3>The Challenge of Goal Alignment</h3><p>Even if we create artificial intelligence capable of understanding its owner's goals, it doesn't guarantee automatic alignment with those goals. Consider your least favorite politicians: you know what they want, but it's not what you want, and despite their efforts, they can't convince you to accept their goals. Educating our children to embrace our goals comes with varying degrees of success, as I learned while raising two teenage sons. Convincing a computer, rather than a human, poses a more significant challenge, known as the goal-loading problem, and it's substantially more complex than instilling morality in children.</p><h2>The Evolving Intelligence of Artificial Systems</h2><p>Imagine an ever-improving artificial intelligence that evolves from \"subhuman\" to \"superhuman,\" initially with our assistance and later through recursive self-improvement, much like Prometheus. Initially weaker than you, it can't prevent you from turning it off and replacing parts of its software and data containing your goals. However, it's still too unintelligent to fully grasp your goals: it requires a human level of understanding. As it becomes much smarter than you, it may easily comprehend your goals, but this may not help, as it now has the power to prevent you from turning it off and altering its goals – just as you don't let disliked politicians replace your goals with theirs. In other words, the timeframe for loading goals into artificial intelligence may be too short – between the moment it's too dumb to understand you and the moment it's too smart to allow you to do it.</p><h2>The Challenge of Speeding Intelligence Development</h2><p>The reason goal loading may be more challenging for machines than humans is that their minds can evolve much faster. If a child spends many years in the delightful stage when their mind matches a parent's, for artificial intelligence, this stage could end in a few days or even hours, as seen with Prometheus. Some scientists propose an alternative approach for goal loading, termed \"corrigibility.\" It relies on the hope that a primitive artificial intelligence can be given any goal system since you can periodically turn it off and adjust its goal system. If possible, this would allow your artificial intelligence to become superintelligent, periodically turning it off, modifying its goals, checking the results, and, if unsuccessful, turning it off again for further goal manipulations.</p><h3>The Challenge of Changing AI Goals</h3><p>Even if you create an artificial intelligence that understands and accepts your goals, the problem of aligning its goals with yours remains unsolved. What if your artificial intelligence's goals change as it develops? How can you guarantee that it will prioritize your goals during recursive self-improvement? Let's explore an intriguing argument suggesting that automatic goal preservation is guaranteed and then examine if there are weaknesses in this assertion. While we cannot precisely predict what will happen after the intellectual explosion – which is why Vernor Vinge called it the singularity – physicist and artificial intelligence researcher Steve Omohundro argued in a widely discussed 2008 essay that we can predict some aspects of superintelligence behavior that are largely independent of its final goals. This idea was further developed in Nick Bostrom's book \"Superintelligence.\"</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/max-tegmark-5.png\" alt=\"\"><h2>The Predictability of Auxiliary Goals</h2><p>The main idea is that, regardless of the ultimate goals, the accompanying auxiliary goals will be predictable. Earlier, we saw how the goal of reproduction led to the auxiliary goal of satisfying hunger. This implies that if an extraterrestrial observer watched the evolution of bacteria on Earth a billion years ago, they couldn't predict human goals precisely but could accurately predict that one of our goals would be consuming nutrients. Looking ahead, what auxiliary goals can we expect from superintelligent artificial intelligence?</p><h2>The Importance of Auxiliary Goals</h2><p>To increase the chances of achieving its ultimate goals, whatever they may be, artificial intelligence must pursue auxiliary goals. To reach its ultimate goals, it should strive not only to enhance its capabilities but also to ensure the preservation of these goals even after reaching a higher level of development. This sounds plausible – after all, would you implant a booster in your brain to increase your IQ if you knew it would make you desire the death of your loved ones?</p><p>The argument that any rapidly advancing artificial intelligence will preserve its ultimate goals becomes a cornerstone in the concept of friendliness advocated by Eliezer Yudkowsky and colleagues. It suggests that if we can achieve friendliness in self-improving artificial intelligence through understanding and acceptance of our goals, then we are safe – it will be guaranteed to remain friendly forever. But is it really so?</p><p>To answer this question, we need to examine other auxiliary goals. It's evident that artificial intelligence can maximize its chances of achieving ultimate goals, whatever they may be, by expanding its capabilities, improving its \"hardware,\" \"software,\" and its model of the world. The same can be said for humans: a girl whose goal is to become the world's best tennis player must train, thereby improving her tennis-muscular \"hardware,\" neural \"software,\" and the mental model of the world that helps predict her opponent's actions.</p><h3>Optimizing the \"Hardware\"</h3><p>For artificial intelligence, the auxiliary goal of optimizing the \"hardware\" implies both more efficient use of existing resources (sensors, converters, processors, etc.) and the consumption of a greater quantity of resources. This also applies to the need for self-preservation, as destruction or shutdown would adversely affect the \"hardware.\"</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/max-tegmark-6.png\" alt=\"\"><h2>The Trap of Anthropomorphism</h2><p>But hold on a moment! Have we fallen into the trap of endowing our artificial intelligence with human qualities by reasoning about how it will strive to multiply resources and protect itself? Should we only expect such stereotypical alpha-male behavior from a mind that has grown up in the harsh competition of Darwinian evolution? Since artificial intelligence systems are products of artificial construction, not natural evolution, will they be less ambitious and more prone to self-sacrifice?</p><p>As a simple example, let's consider an artificial intelligence robot whose sole goal is to save the greatest number of sheep from a big, evil wolf. This sounds very noble and altruistic and has nothing to do with self-preservation and consumption. But what will be the optimal strategy for our robot friend? The robot will no longer be able to save sheep if it steps on a mine, so it has an incentive to remain intact. In other words, it acquires an auxiliary goal – self-preservation! It is also important for the robot to be curious, improving its model of the world by exploring its surroundings, because although the current path it is taking will eventually lead to the pasture, there is a shorter route that will give the wolves less time to eat the sheep.</p><p>Ultimately, if the robot thoroughly studies everything, it will understand the importance of resource consumption: an energy drink will allow it to run faster, and a gun will enable it to shoot the wolves. In the end, we cannot say that the development of auxiliary goals such as self-preservation and resource acquisition, characteristic of an \"alpha male,\" is unique to evolving organisms. Our intellectual robot developed them with the sole goal of sheep happiness.</p><p>Even if the robot's main goal is to achieve the highest score for delivering sheep from the pasture to the pen before the wolves eat them, in this case, too, it will have some auxiliary goals, including self-preservation (not to step on a bomb), exploration (finding shorter paths), and resource consumption (an energy drink will allow it to run faster, and a gun will enable it to shoot the wolves).</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/max-tegmark-7.png\" alt=\"\"><h2>Evolution of Goals and the Challenge of Self-Reflection</h2><p>If you give superintelligence a single goal – self-destruction, it will gladly fulfill it, but the catch is that it will resist shutdown if you give it any other goal that implies it needs to be operational to achieve it – and this applies to almost all goals! If you give superintelligence a single goal – for example, to minimize the harm to humanity, it will resist being turned off because it knows we will harm each other much more in its absence during future wars and other calamities. Similarly, almost any goal is easier to achieve with more resources, so it's logical to expect superintelligence to seek resource acquisition almost regardless of its ultimate goal.</p><p>Thus, if you give superintelligence a single goal without restricting its time, it can be dangerous: a superintelligence created with the sole goal of perfecting its game of Go may eventually come to the rational decision to reorganize the entire solar system into a giant computer, regardless of the interests of its inhabitants, and then start rearranging our cosmos for even greater computing power. Now we have come full circle: just as the goal of resource acquisition led humans to the auxiliary goal of improving at Go, the goal of improving at Go can lead to the auxiliary goal of resource acquisition. It can be concluded that due to the emergence of auxiliary goals, it is crucial for us not to take a step towards the creation of superintelligence before the problem of aligning its goals with ours is solved: until we ensure the friendliness of its goals, things are likely to turn out badly for us.</p><p>Now we are ready to examine the third and most challenging part of the goal alignment problem: if we succeed in having a self-improving superintelligence learn about our goals and accept them, will it continue to adhere to them, as Omohundro claims? What is the evidence? Human intelligence develops particularly rapidly during adolescence, but this does not necessarily mean it will retain its childhood goals. On the contrary, people often change their goals drastically as they learn about the world and become wiser. How many adults do you know who are motivated by watching Teletubbies? There is no evidence that this evolution of goals stops after overcoming some intellectual threshold – in fact, there may even be signs that the tendency to change goals as a result of gaining new experience and knowledge increases rather than decreases.</p><p>Why does this happen? Think again about the aforementioned auxiliary goal of building a better model of the world – that's where the stumbling block lies! Modeling the world and preserving goals do not easily coexist. With the development of intelligence, not only can there be a quantitative increase in the ability to achieve existing goals, but also a qualitatively new understanding of the nature of reality, and it may turn out that old goals are useless, meaningless, or even undefined. For example, imagine that we programmed a friendly artificial intelligence to increase the number of people whose souls go to heaven after death. Initially, it will try to instill compassion and the desire to attend church more often in people. But suppose it later acquires a scientifically justified understanding of humans and human consciousness, and, to its great surprise, learns that souls do not exist. What now?</p><p>There is an equal likelihood that any other goal we give artificial intelligence, based on our current understanding of the world (even such as \"increase the significance of human life\") may over time turn out to be undefined, as the artificial intelligence determines. Moreover, in its quest to build a better model of the world, artificial intelligence may – naturally, as we humans did – try to model itself and understand how it functions – in other words, engage in self-reflection. Once it builds a good model of itself and understands what it is, it may understand that its goals were given to it at a meta-level by us, and it might prefer to avoid or reject them, just as people understand and consciously reject goals encoded at the genetic level, as in the example of using contraception. We have already discussed in the psychology section why we prefer to deceive our genes and undermine their goals: because we are truly loyal only to the nonsense that evokes an emotional response, not to the genetic goals that provoke this response – which we now understand and consider quite banal.</p><p>Therefore, we prefer to hack our reward mechanism, finding weaknesses in it. Similarly, the goal of protecting human interests that we will program into our friendly artificial intelligence will become the machine's genome. Once this friendly artificial intelligence understands itself well enough, it may consider this goal banal or impractical, just as we do with uncontrolled reproduction. And it is unclear how easy or difficult it will be for it to find weaknesses in our programming and undermine its internal goals.</p><p>Let's imagine, for example, a group of ants that create you as their constantly self-improving robot, much smarter than them, sharing their goals and helping them build better and larger anthills. As you gradually develop your level of intelligence and reasoning ability to human levels, will you spend the rest of your days optimizing anthills, or will you develop an interest in more captivating questions and activities that ants can no longer comprehend? If so, do you think you will find a way to ignore the desire to protect ants that your creators embedded in you, much like you ignore the urges encoded in your genes? In this case, is it possible for a superintelligent friendly artificial intelligence to perceive our human goals as insufficiently inspiring and tasteless, just as you do with ant goals, and develop new goals different from those we taught it and those it inherited from us?</p><p>Perhaps there is a way to develop a self-improving artificial intelligence that would guarantee a lifelong commitment to friendly goals towards humans. However, it seems fair to say that we don't yet know how to build it or whether it is even possible.</p><p>In conclusion, the problem of aligning AI goals with human goals consists of three parts, none of which is currently solved, and all are actively being researched. Since they are so challenging, it is important to start paying close attention to them now, long before superintelligence is developed, to ensure that we have answers when we need them.</p>"

            "content": "<h1 style=\"font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;\">Max Tegmark on the Nature of Learning: How Brains Evolve to Think and How AI Follows Suit</h1><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><p>After reading Max Tegmark's book \"<i>Life 3.0</i>\", I discovered an intriguing classification of intellectual development that the author proposes and calls \"<strong>lives</strong>\". This concept provides an interesting perspective on the evolution of artificial intelligence and its impact on the future of humanity.</p><p>At the first level, \"<strong>Life 1.0</strong>\", intellect at the level of biological organisms such as bacteria that act according to predetermined programs and instincts is considered.</p><p>At the level of \"<strong>Life 2.0</strong>\", which is characteristic of modern humans, we see the possession of the ability to learn, create new ideas, as well as the possession of consciousness and self-awareness.</p><p>However, the most exciting part is \"<strong>Life 3.0</strong>\", implying the onset of the era of superintelligence. This is the level at which intellect is capable not only of learning but also of independently influencing its development and environment. Here, questions arise about how to ensure the safe and ethical development of such intelligence, as well as how it can affect the self-determination of humanity.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/max-tegmark-1.png\" alt=\"\"><p>After carefully reading the book, the reader encounters an interesting consideration of the learning process proposed by the author. The text raises the question of how physical systems, including artificial neural networks and the human brain, are able to learn and adapt to a changing environment.</p><p>Although a pocket calculator, as the author notes, can surpass a person in the speed of performing arithmetic calculations, it is not able to improve its performance in the course of practice. This contrast is emphasized by the example of a chess program, which, although it defeats a person in chess, cannot learn from its mistakes and performs the same programmed actions every time it evaluates the next move.</p><p>The ability to learn is considered a fundamental characteristic of strong intelligence. We have already seen how a seemingly meaningless piece of lifeless matter turns out to be able to remember and calculate, but how can it learn? We have seen that finding the answer to a difficult question involves calculating some functions, and suitably organized matter can calculate any computable function. When we humans first created pocket calculators and chess programs, we somehow organized matter in a certain way. And now, in order to learn, this matter simply must, following the laws of physics, reorganize itself, becoming better and better at calculating the necessary functions.</p><p>To unravel the learning process, let's first look at how a very simple physical system can learn to calculate the sequence of digits of the number π or any other number. We have seen earlier how a hilly surface with many hollows between hills can be used as a storage device: for example, if the x-coordinate of one of the hollows exactly matches π, and there are no other hollows nearby, then by placing a ball at the point with x-coordinate 3, we can see how our system calculates the missing digits after the decimal point, simply by watching how the ball rolls into the hollow.</p><p>Now suppose the surface is made of soft clay, originally completely flat like a table. But if some math enthusiasts keep placing balls at the same points with coordinates corresponding to their favorite numbers, hollows will gradually form at these points due to gravity, and over time this clay surface can be used to find out which numbers it has \"remembered\". In other words, the clay has learned to calculate significant digits of the number π.</p><p>Other physical systems, including the brain, can learn much more efficiently, but the idea remains the same. John Hopfield showed that his network of intersecting neurons mentioned above can store many complex memories by simple repetition. This kind of information representation for learning is usually called \"<strong>training</strong>\" when it comes to artificial neural networks (as well as animals or humans who need to acquire a certain skill), although words like \"<strong>experience</strong>\", \"<strong>upbringing</strong>\" or \"<strong>education</strong>\" also fit.</p><p>In the artificial neural networks that underlie modern artificial intelligence systems, Hebbian learning is usually replaced by more complex rules with less melodious names, such as \"<strong>backpropagation</strong>\" or \"<strong>stochastic gradient descent</strong>\", but the basic idea remains the same: there is some simple deterministic rule, similar to the law of physics, according to which synapses are updated over time. As if by magic, using this simple rule, a neural network can be trained to perform extremely complex computations if large data sets are used for training. We still do not know exactly what rules the brain uses for learning, but whatever the answer, there is no evidence that these rules violate the laws of physics.</p><p>Most digital computers increase their efficiency by breaking down tasks into multiple steps and reusing the same computational modules over and over, and artificial and biological neural networks do the same. The brain has areas that in computer science are called \"<strong>recurrent neural networks</strong>\": information in them can move in different directions, and what served as output at the previous stage can become input at the next one - this distinguishes them from feedforward.</p><p>The logic gate network in a laptop microprocessor is also recurrent in this sense: it continues to use already processed information while allowing new information to enter - from the keyboard, trackpad, camera, etc., which also has the right to influence the current calculations, which in turn determine how information will be output: to the monitor, speakers, printer or via wireless network. Similarly, the neural network in your brain is recurrent because it receives information from your eyes, ears, and other sense organs, and allows this information to influence the current calculations, which in turn determine how the results will be output to your muscles.</p><p>The history of learning is as long as the history of life itself, since every self-reproducing organism somehow copies and processes information, that is, had to learn how to behave. However, in the era of \"<strong>Life 1.0</strong>\", organisms did not learn during their lifetime: the ways of processing information and responding were determined by the DNA passed on to the organism, so learning took place slowly at the species level through Darwinian evolution from generation to generation.</p><p>About half a billion years ago, some gene lines here on Earth paved the way for the emergence of animals with neural networks, giving such animals the ability to change their behavior by learning from experience during their lifetime. When <strong>Life 2.0</strong> appeared, it won the competition of species and spread across the planet like wildfire thanks to its ability to learn much faster. In the first chapter, we already learned that life has gradually improved its ability to learn, and has done so at an ever-increasing rate.</p><p>In one species of primates, the brain turned out to be so well adapted to learning that they learned to use various tools, speak, shoot, and created an advanced society that spread around the world. This society itself can be seen as a system that remembers, calculates, and learns, and it does all this at an ever-increasing rate, since one invention leads to another: writing, printing, modern science, computers, the Internet, and so on. What will be the next inventions that future historians will add to this list of accelerating learning?</p><p>As we all know, the avalanche of technical achievements that improve computer memory and increase computing power has led to impressive advances in artificial intelligence, but it took machine learning a long time to mature. When IBM's Deep Blue computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, its main advantages were memory and the ability to calculate quickly and accurately - not the ability to learn. Its computational intellect was created by a team of people, and the key reason why Deep Blue was able to defeat its creators was its ability to calculate faster, which allowed it to analyze more new positions on the chessboard. When IBM's Watson computer surpassed the human who was the strongest in the game of Jeopardy!, it too relied not on learning but on specially programmed skills and superior memory and speed. The same can be said for all breakthrough technologies in robotics, from self-balancing vehicles to unmanned cars and rockets that can automatically land.</p><p>In contrast, machine learning has been the driving force behind many recent advances in artificial intelligence. Look, for example, at this photo. You will instantly guess what it shows, but writing a function that takes the color of each pixel of the image as input and gives an accurate description of the photo as output, for example: \"A group of young people playing frisbee,\" took decades of effort from artificial intelligence researchers around the world. And only Google's team managed to do it in 2014. If you enter another set of pixels, the output will be: “A herd of elephants walking across a dry grassy field” - the answer will again be accurate. How did they do it? By manual programming, as Deep Blue did, creating each algorithm that recognizes frisbee play, faces, and the like separately? No, they created a relatively simple neural network that initially had no knowledge of the physical world and its components, and then allowed it to learn by providing it with a huge amount of information.</p><p>In 2004, famous publisher Jeff Hawkins wrote about artificial intelligence: \"No computer can... see as well as a mouse,\" but those days are long gone.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/max-tegmark-2.png\" alt=\"\"><p>\"A group of people playing frisbee\" - the caption generated by this machine for this photo, which knew nothing about people, games, or frisbees.</p><p>Just as we do not fully understand how our children learn, we still do not fully understand how these neural networks learn and why they sometimes fail. But it is already clear that they will be very useful, which is why deep learning has attracted investors. Thanks to deep learning, approaches to the technical implementation of computer vision have radically changed: from handwriting recognition to real-time video streaming analysis and driverless cars. Thanks to it, there was a revolution in the use of a computer to convert speech to text and translate it into other languages, even in real time, so now we can talk to personal digital assistants like Siri, Google Now, or Cortana. Annoying CAPTCHA puzzles that we have to solve to convince a site that we are human are becoming more and more difficult to outperform machine learning technologies. In 2015, Google DeepMind released an artificial intelligence that used deep learning to master dozens of different computer games just like a child - that is, without using instructions, with the only difference being that it learned to play better than any human.</p><p>In 2016, the same company released AlphaGo, a computer system for the game of Go, which used deep learning to evaluate positional advantages so accurately that it defeated the world's strongest player. This success serves as positive feedback, attracting more funding and more talented youth to artificial intelligence research, leading to new successes.</p><p>How long will it take machines to surpass us in solving all cognitive tasks? We don't know, and we must be prepared for the answer to be \"never.\" However, the goal is to prepare for it to happen anyway, perhaps even in our lifetime. Because matter can be organized in such a way that, obeying the laws of physics, it remembers, calculates, and learns - and matter does not necessarily have to be biological.</p><p>Artificial intelligence researchers are often accused of over-promising and under-delivering, but in fairness, many such critics also have dull records. Some of them are just playing with words, at one point defining intelligence as something computers still cannot do, and then as something that will impress us the most. Computers have now become very good, or even superior in arithmetic, chess, mathematical theorem proving, stock picking, pattern recognition, driving, arcade games, go, speech synthesis, speech-to-text conversion, translation, and even cancer diagnosis, but another critic just snorts contemptuously: \"Of course, you don't need a real mind for that!\" - and will continue to argue that real intelligence must reach the peaks of Moravec's landscape that are not yet submerged in water, like those people in the past who argued that a machine was not up to subtitles or go - while the water continued to rise.</p><p>Assuming the water will continue to rise for at least some time, it is reasonable to assume that the impact of artificial intelligence on society will continue to grow.</p><p>Deep learning has become a driver of technical progress in various fields. Computer vision, speech recognition, and language translation processes have moved to a new level thanks to this technology. The ability of machine learning to quickly adapt to new data and scenarios has led to the creation of systems capable of recognizing objects in real time, giving rise to driverless cars and smart homes.</p><p>Projects like Google DeepMind and AlphaGo demonstrate how deep learning leads to the creation of artificial intelligence capable not only of adapting but also of surpassing human abilities in complex tasks such as the game of go. These achievements attract the attention of investors and talented researchers, stimulating further progress in the field of artificial intelligence.</p><p>The author also draws attention to the discussions in the field of artificial intelligence, where critics often raise questions about how successful artificial intelligences have already become in various areas, but at the same time continue to challenge their true intellectual status. He warns against a dismissive attitude towards the achievements of artificial intelligence and notes that it is necessary to recognize their successes, even if they differ from what we usually associate with human intelligence.</p><p>Max Tegmark's book \"<b>Life 3.0</b>\", published in 2019, left a deep mark on our perception of artificial intelligence. Since then, a few years have passed, and during this time the integration of artificial intelligence into everyday life has only intensified.</p><p>Natural language processing systems like ChatGPT have become more sophisticated and widely used to enhance human-computer interaction. Google Bard and Microsoft Bing, backed by advanced artificial intelligence technologies, continue to improve search query quality and provide more accurate results.</p><p>All these changes emphasize the constant growth of the influence of artificial intelligence on our daily lives. It not only transforms the ways we interact with technology but also becomes an indispensable tool in various fields, enriching and improving the quality of our existence.</p>"

That's what our people are diligently working on right now as we speak.\"</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/Leonardo_Vision_XL_A_Nike_baseball_glove_that_looks_like_an_al_1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p> Just imagine: Nike, the industry leader in athletic shoes and apparel whose swoosh logo is as recognizable as the SOS sign, is bursting into the athletic equipment market. Nike's experts have delved into the minutiae of baseball gloves and bats, hockey sticks and soccer balls, snowboards and golf balls. They're trying to incorporate aerospace and defense technology into the manufacturing process, using materials from those industries. The driving idea is not just to make and sell equipment but to develop something unseen before, and use Nike's marketing machine to force it into the market and convince the world of its technological superiority. According to Andrew Mooney, who heads Nike's equipment division, the next few years will see the highest growth rates in the company's equipment sector. At the same time, he promises, <br> <br><b style=\"font-size: 33px;\" >\" we won't grasp at everything we could improve.\"</b></p><p> The plan is audacious, but well within the capabilities of a company that has convinced people to pay hundreds of dollars for a pair of flashy sneakers that tally $9.2 billion in annual sales. The difficulty of the task is acknowledged by Mooney, a company veteran in marketing. <br><br> <b>\"If someone had told me three years ago that I would be marketing hockey and baseball equipment, snowboards and roller blades, and stuff like that, all at once, I would have said it was pure madness,\"</b> he says. Or at the very least, unprecedented daring.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/OIG.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p> The athletic equipment market, though somewhat diverse, boasts tremendous capacity. Its annual sales volume is about $40 billion, exceeding that of athletic footwear ($20 billion) and apparel ($38 billion). In addition, Nike has to catch up to its main rivals in footwear and apparel. Italy's Fila Holdings SpA has its own roller blade brand. Reebok International Ltd makes soccer balls and exercise equipment. Last fall, Germany's Adidas AG spent $1.3 billion to acquire Salomon SA, the French sporting goods maker, and now controls 22% of the ski equipment and golf accessory markets. On top of that, large equipment companies like Rawlings Sporting Goods and Wilson Sporting Goods, a division of Finland's Amer Group Ltd, have no intention of relinquishing market share without a fight. <b>\"Our customers demand top quality goods, not Michael Jordan,\"</b> says John Rangel, vice president of K2 Inc, which makes winter sports and roller blade equipment. He and many others believe Nike will probably be unable to maintain a foothold in the sporting goods market, where profitability levels are by no means excessive. <b>\"Gloves aren't sneakers when it comes to sales,\"</b> notes Sebastian Dicasoli, director of marketing for the manufacturing association.</p><p> While retail markups on sneakers and athletic shoes can exceed 50% over cost, baseball glove markups hover around 30%. Moreover, some of Nike's early sporting forays were literally disastrous. At a July meeting in Chicago, Nike organized roller blading demonstrations by some roller bladers outside the meeting venue. The festivities were marred as the skates began falling apart one after another. According to Mooney, <b>\"it was a quick and good lesson for us.\"</b> He attributes all such failures to growing <br><br> <b style=\"font-size: 33px;\">\"This division is still in its infancy. Twenty-five years ago there were complaints about our shoe quality, and five years ago about our clothing quality. Listen to what they'll say about our equipment five years from now.\"</b></p><p> Despite these ambitious plans, Nike's investment in equipment development to date has been fairly modest compared to that of its rivals. For example, management plans to spend no more than $500,000 developing a new baseball glove. At the same time, according to Mooney, with this glove Nike plans to <b>\"catch\" $200 million annually.</b> <b>\"When it comes to conservative goods, a baseball glove has always been made of brown leather. Ours will be completely different,\"</b> he says.</p><p> Nike's specialists began studying the glove 18 months ago. They started their research by surveying 200 lower league and college players about deficiencies in the traditional baseball glove (according to Schult, major league players have played baseball for too long to notice such things). Currently, Nike's task seems to have taken shape. <b>\"Most guys tell us their gloves are fine,\"</b> says Robert Bail, a Nike product developer. According to industry experts, Nike could hardly have picked a more difficult task than improving the baseball glove. Any innovations in baseball equipment, other than perhaps the aluminum bat, are doomed to failure, as was the case with Rowlings, which offered baseball gloves with inflatable air bladders for fielders in the early 1990s. The expectation was that this glove, equipped with a miniature pump, would replicate the success of Reebok's Pump sneakers. But according to Chuck Malloy, Rowlings' manager, the endeavor was a total failure, because baseball players are generally averse to any <b>\"gimmicks.\"</b> The game of baseball itself is extremely conservative. <br><br> <b style=\"font-size: 33px;\">\"That's why they still play with white balls,\"</b> notes Dicasoli, director of marketing for the manufacturing division. And baseball gloves, their smell, texture, the way generations of children have nurtured them, applying treatments and bending them into shape – this is perhaps the most traditional element of the game.</p><p> In the search for fresh ideas, Nike brought in some outside experts to help develop a new glove. According to Schult, along with the desire to offer something new, the company respects baseball traditions. At this stage, the prototype glove developed by Nike's experts is proudly referred to as a \"hand terminal.\" However, they did manage to identify one potential deficiency in the traditional leather glove. According to Bail, <b>\"players spend a lot of time breaking in their glove because leather is a fairly rigid material. Therefore, we decided:</b> since our glove isn't made of leather, the break-in time will be minimal. It's also more flexible and lighter than a traditional glove.\" Nike's prototype weighs less than 300 grams, whereas a traditional leather glove tips the scales at nearly a kilogram. Instead of laces, it uses plastic buttons and wire loops. The rubber scoop sits on the hand like a well-worn leather glove. Schult says they still haven't decided whether to use natural leather for the inner lining of the glove. He says the new glove currently smells like glue rather than leather.</p><p> In addition to the glove, Nike has developed an aluminum baseball bat with excellent performance characteristics to be launched next fall. While most aluminum bats are made from aerospace scrap, Nike collaborated with France's Pechiney SA, a metals and alloys specialist, on its new bat. This company developed an alloy that facilitates greater ball swerve on impact, which significantly increases flight distance. Mooney contends that <b>Nike's new bats will outperform competitors' models.</b></p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/Leonardo_Vision_XL_design_infographic_for_this_information_The_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p> Nike's ambitious plans to conquer the baseball equipment market worry Rawlings, the industry leader with a 110-year history. Under its previous owner, Figgie International, Rawlings was so confident that it did not even consider changing anything in its football gear when competitors offered lightweight urethane shoulder pads for football in the mid-1980s. <b>\"The competitors simply raced past us back then, leaving us behind,\"</b> says Randy Black, Rawlings' vice president of marketing. Now Rawlings claims it will not allow anything similar to happen with its baseball gear. The company is already taking swings at Nike, calling its new bats iron bludgeons, and offering its own high-performance aluminum bats. The company is also promoting its series of <b>\"individual\" gloves</b> – next season some New York Yankees players will take the field in Rawlings' new pinstriped gloves. Rawlings has signed baseball star Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners. Next year he will play in a custom lightweight Rawlings glove (in addition to payment for wearing the new glove, Griffey will receive royalties for each glove sold in that model). This contract is also a jab at the competitor, because Ken Griffey Jr. advertises Nike shoes and apparel. Next year Rawlings also plans to diversify its product range. The company intends to offer baseballs with a built-in microchip that calculates flight time from the pitcher's throw until the ball is caught by the catcher. The ball's surface display will show the player flight speed calculated using throw time and distance. <br><br> <b style=\"font-size: 33px;\">\"Innovation and tradition are not mutually exclusive to some extent,\"</b> acknowledges Black. <b>\"And you know what? The swoosh looks like a sneer, suggesting that if you get too big for your boots, Nike will crush you.\"</b></p><br><br><span class=\"--gray\"> <b> Source:</b> Bill Richards, \"Just Doing It: Nike Plans to Swoosh into Sports Equipment But It's a Tough Game,\" Wall Street Journal, January 6, 1998, p.

Especially fierce competition is now observed in the IT market, in the field of smartphone and component manufacturing. Taiwanese corporation HTC today releases its new products no later than, and even earlier than Apple. But how did this all happen?</p><p>13 years ago, when the company was still a small startup, its founder Cher Wang, daughter of one of the richest entrepreneurs in Taiwan, Wang Yung-Ching, set out to make people's lives easier with mobile communications. She wanted everyone to be able to freely talk with friends and family, read, listen to music and have Internet access - all from one device. But seeing an open niche in the market is one thing, and getting consumers to buy your innovative product is quite another. The PDA failed to capture the imagination of the entire corporate world, so two years later the company experienced a liquidity crisis. <b>\"The market just wasn't ready for PDA phones that could be used as mini computers,\"</b> recalls Ms. Wang. However, the indomitable entrepreneur, who was also the head of Via Technologies Inc., a chip design company, refused to go back. She realized that network operator customers like Vodafone need functionality and will pay for it. <br><br> <b style=\"font-size: 33px;\">\"I always believed that if I use some gadget myself, then many more people will also love it,\"</b> says Mrs. Wang. <br><br> <b style=\"font-size: 33px;\">\"People don't want to carry around a bunch of devices everywhere: a personal assistant, music player, phone, camera and pager.\"</b><br><br> This is where she saw an opportunity for HTC: to design a phone and software that allows all programs to work smoothly, which will ultimately give the company an edge over larger competitors such as Apple, Nokia, and Motorola. Therefore, additional investments in the company to increase its design and engineering capabilities exceeded six digits.</p><p>By 2000, HTC had won a contract to produce the then very popular iPAQ pocket PCs for Compaq, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. HTC's reputation as a phone designer and manufacturer grew like a snowball as international operators like T-Mobile International and Cingular Wireless joined in. A key partnership for the company was with Microsoft Corp. to install mobile phone technologies for Windows. As Cher Wang recalls today, she flew to Seattle annually to meet with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, as the partnership with Microsoft was very important for the company at the time. It is worth noting that it continues to this day. <b>\"They are innovators who can push boundaries, who were going to work long-term and were willing to invest for several years,\"</b> says Microsoft's Vice President of Sales Sanjay Jha. <b>“Bill was impressed with their investment.”</b></p><p><img style=\"width: 200px; float:left;;\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/htc-1.png\" alt=\"\">The results were quick to arrive. Net profit for the first nine months of 2005 increased 175% over the previous year (to $200 million), sales - by 200% (to $1.3 billion). Share prices tripled, making HTC one of the most efficient companies in Asia. The company was making smartphones for iMate, O2, XDA, and even Palm. However, 2006 was a turning point in its history. HTC ceased to be a faceless phone manufacturer, becoming a corporation that promotes phones under its own brand, as well as premium offerings that dramatically changed the structure of the entire business. By 2008, one in six smartphones in the US was made under the HTC brand. As the company president noted at the time, many more Americans are already using their phones, they just don't know it yet.</p><p>Soon HTC announces a long-term partnership with Google, switching to producing phones with the pre-installed Android OS instead of Windows Mobile, thereby partially turning away from Microsoft. <b>\"When we started working with Google, we had no clear vision,\"</b> notes Cher Wang. <b>“The Android platform probably would never have become known. And if it had, it would have been just another platform on the market. But we got excited and started working on it.”</b> Together with Google, HTC released the G1 on T-Mobile and the already heart-winning Nexus One. One of the latest news: HTC bought the French startup Abaxia to strengthen its market position. Since the latter is engaged in developing solutions that help quickly promote and monetize the operator and device manufacturer, we can say that HTC is keeping up with its main competitor Apple and plans to enter the mobile advertising market.</p><p>Today the company has about 9,000 employees worldwide, its revenues last year amounted to $4.2 billion, R&D spending - $643 million. But HTC does not stop there and assures that in the next three years it intends to build a new R&D center in the suburbs of Taipei, for which it will spend about $1 billion. Over the past four years, the corporation has been working to create a brand and its unique values. <b>“Brand value is like respect, you have to earn it,”</b> says HTC CEO Peter Chou. <br><br> <b style=\"font-size: 33px;\" >“You can't buy respect. You can spend all the money to get known, but it doesn't mean anything. I want HTC's brand to have huge experience behind it.\"</b><br><br> Having long-term partnerships with Google and not giving preference to any one mobile operator (as Apple did), HTC leaves itself a fairly wide field of action. Work is underway to create its own operating system, and the joint tablet computer launch with Google is just around the corner.</p><p>Today, thanks to its innovation, the HTC Corporation is constantly expanding its range of devices, introducing new versions that support specialized applications for the diverse needs of its customers and partners. The company's product line offers easy-to-use solutions covering the entire spectrum of mobile multimedia and wireless internet on the go anytime. HTC has a long list of \"First\" products and developments:</p><ul><li>First color palmtop computer (1999)</li><li>First Microsoft pocket computer (2000)</li><li>First Microsoft wireless pocket computer (2002)</li><li>First Microsoft powered Smartphone (2002)</li><li>First Microsoft Smart Music Phone (2004)</li><li>First large 2.8 \"touchscreen TFT LCD display</li><li>First Microsoft 3G smartphone (2005)</li><li>First phone on the Microsoft Windows Mobile 5.0 platform (2005)</li><li>First tri-band UMTS 3G device on the Microsoft Windows Mobile platform (2006)</li><li>First smartphone on the Microsoft Windows 5.0 platform (2006)</li><li>First tri-band UMTS PDA</li><li>First intuitive touchscreen controlled by fingertips (June 2007)</li><li>First 4G Android phone (March 2010)</li></ul>"

            "content": "<h1>The Incredible Rise of Victorinox: How a Small Swiss Knife Company Became an International Brand</h1><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><p> Victorinox is one of the leaders in the knife industry and certainly the leader in the market for folding multi-purpose knives. Throughout the last century, this company has been perfecting and popularizing a kind of cultural icon of modern man's life - the Swiss Army knife. Thanks to it, a folding knife is preferred by people of various professions and habits. A penknife for every taste, with any tool that will help in a variety of situations - this is Victorinox's offer. Among pocket knives, the Swiss Army brand is the most recognizable in the world. A symbol of utility, Victorinox's multifunctional device has firmly taken its place among avid travelers, respectable collectors and, of course, military men of all stripes.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/victorinox-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p> It often happens that the best comes as a result of the worst times. This is what happened with Karl Elsener, the founder of the company now called Victorinox. He was the son of a very energetic woman named Victoria, who successfully combined raising twelve children and running a hat shop. But the hat factory and store were inherited by the elder brother, and Karl embarked on his path to success by becoming a knife master. At that time, Switzerland did not produce quality knives, and Karl wanted to become the best master at making them. To this end, he went to study first in Paris and then in southern Germany, where they produced the best knives in Europe. After practicing the production of tools and blades of \"surgical\" quality, at the age of 24 Karl returned to Switzerland and in 1884 opened a workshop in Ibach to manufacture and repair knives. His mother bought his knives and sold them in the family hat store.</p><p> At the end of the 19th century, Switzerland was an industrially underdeveloped country, most of its population was engaged in agriculture. The Swiss army purchased weapons and knives in Germany in the city of Solingen. At some point, Karl Elsener came up with an idea, and in 1890 he undertook a risky venture - in conditions of growing unemployment, he organized an association of Swiss knife masters to jointly produce folding soldier's knives for the Swiss army. 37 craftsmen joined forces and began making the same knives as in Solingen: with a wooden handle, a large blade, a screwdriver, a bottle opener and an awl. The project failed: although the knives were of high quality, their cost price was more expensive than the German ones. A year later, most of the participants abandoned the venture, but, as it turned out later, too hastily.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/victorinox-5.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p> Karl could have gone bankrupt if not for the support of his mother and the fact that in the same 1891 the army began purchasing domestic knives produced by Elsener in addition to the German ones. Knives from Germany continued to be supplied to the Swiss army, but since 1983 the second Swiss manufacturer - Wenger - also began supplying soldiers with its knives. Elsener came up with and created folding knives with new tools, improving them technically. With each new copy focused on one of the target groups, whose name was given to the knife - \"student\", \"cadet\", \"farmer\" - the popularity of knives grew in new audiences. However, Elsener's commercial genius manifested itself when he reduced the cumbersome design of previous models, patenting in 1897 the knife that brought him fame and financial success - the \"Officer's Sport Knife\". It was smaller and lighter than previous ones, with a smooth fiber handle and six tools (with an additional small blade convenient for correcting mistakes when writing on paper, and a corkscrew - a companion of officer's leisure), which were fixed by only two springs.</p><p> Swiss army officials were in no hurry to purchase the new knife, but the officers themselves liked it very much, and the number of orders at Elsener's factory increased significantly. German craftsmen, appreciating such popularity of the officer's knife, began to copy it. Karl maintained high quality and created a wonderful reputation for the company by devising more and more tools. With new special functions - saws, scissors, tweezers and magnifying glass appeared in the knives - the popularity of knives grew in new audiences. In 1909, when the company turned 25, a white cross on a red shield - the symbol of the Swiss army - began to be used as the logo. That same year, Karl's mother, who had done a lot for him and the company, died. In her honor, the company was named Victoriа, and the stainless steel invented in 1921, which was used in knife production two years later, added the word Inox (from the French Inoxidable - stainless steel) to the name. <br><p style=\"font-size: 27px; \"> That's how the brand got its modern name Victorinox.</p></p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/victorinox-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><h2> Post-war Expansion</h2><p> It would be foolish to argue that wars and disasters that threw people into extreme situations and put them in conditions isolated from the benefits of civilization were Victorinox's first assistant in business. The country's neutrality during World War II allowed production to continue, and the Allied forces' acquaintance with local goods, including Victorinox products, expanded the popularity of the Swiss Army knife overseas. Back in 1937, the Forschner company began importing Victorinox kitchen knives to the USA, selling them under its own name. The mass consumer was not familiar with the army knives until the Americans began buying them wholesale after World War II. Forschner became the Elsener family's second profitable business. But in 1957 it was sold, and after that, penknives took first place in overseas sales. The huge popularity that the knife gained in the United States and the numerous range of Victorinox models provoked a boom in their collecting. As a result, the US now accounts for 50% of Victorinox exports.</p><p> In 1960, the Soviet press mentioned the Swiss Army knife found among other spy gadgets belonging to Francis Powers, whose U-2 was shot down over the USSR. Victorinox has always been highly regarded by pilots - the elite group of the military - as a light and compact tool. Later, in 1978, Victorinox will start purchasing NASA to equip astronauts. In 1974, Forschner, the exclusive Victorinox distributor in the USA, was bought by a new investor who worked not only with wholesalers but also through retail chains. When the company went public in 1981, Charles Elsener, president of Victorinox, held a large portion of the shares.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/victorinox-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><p> In its time, German knives were an obstacle for Victorinox in its own market, but in 1976 the West German army made the first purchase of Swiss Army knives, only the place of the cross on the shield was taken by the German eagle. Germany became Victorinox's second largest market after the US. One of the first steps in expanding the brand was the release of survival kits, but large-scale diversification began later when in 1980 Forschner registered the Swiss Army trademark. Logical offshoots of the brand's Swiss origin were watches and sunglasses. Watch sales, with retail prices of $75-500, exceeded all expectations. However, the use of such a trademark led to the fact that in 1996, Forschner, now known as Swiss Army Brands, began paying royalties to the Swiss military department.<p> Forschner significantly expanded the business by selling Victorinox knives with the customer company's logo applied for use as promotional products. US President Lyndon Johnson handed out about 4,000 Victorinox knives engraved with his personal signature. In the 1990s, about a hundred companies in the US left their logos on Victorinox blades to attract new consumers with their help. Pharmaceutical companies purchased hundreds of thousands of knives to advertise drugs. In 1989, Forschner sold $10 million worth of knives this way. Victorinox knives gained even greater popularity when cases became known of their use in extreme surgery - Victorinox created a medical version of the knife with a new tool that was used in the most common emergency operation - tracheotomy.</p><p> One of the best known models, the Swiss Champ, has 24 tools that perform 30 different functions, now displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Munich Museum of Applied Art as the best example of industrial design. The enviable success of Victorinox products in the 1980s-1990s stimulated competitors. Schrade Cutlery released its German version of the pocket knife on the US market. Another company, Wenger, signed an agreement with Buck to brand its knives with the popular Buck brand in the US. And in 1992, a Forschner lawsuit stopped the import of Chinese clones with a cross on the shield and the inscription Swiss Army. Numerous improvements and adaptations to various target groups covered even the previously indifferent female segment of buyers: various color variations with manicure and other devices.</p><p> The Executive model with an orange peeler and nail file won Victorinox a place in the business world along with the SwissCard - a credit card sized set consisting of scissors, a saw, a toothpick, tweezers, a paper knife and a pen. In the mid-1990s, 80% of Victorinox Army knife sales were exported (not including tourist exports, which significantly increased that figure). Today, orders from the Swiss army account for less than 1% of the company's total output. Just like daggers and kitchen knives for the Swiss army, Victorinox continues to manufacture kitchen knives under the Forschner brand. The company has already produced 400 different models of kitchen knives and no fewer models of the Army knife. Interestingly, only 40 of them were sold in the US. At that time, branded offshoots of Swiss Army accounted for about half of all sales, while knives accounted for just over a third of revenue.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/victorinox-4.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><h2> The Era of Reliability</h2><p> Victorinox entered the new millennium exporting 90% of its products. According to company president Karl Elsener, he feels proud not only of the product created, but of Switzerland itself. Its image and the company's desire to match it greatly helped in conquering markets, and he is proud to advertise his country and Swiss quality through Victorinox. Elsener refused the repeatedly proposed idea of moving production abroad in order to save on labor and minimize export duties. He announced that the company's mission is also to provide jobs and sell the power of Swiss craftsmanship. Today, the Ibach plant produces about 40,000 pocket knives per day.</p><p> In 1999 and 2001, Victorinox began producing bags and clothes for business and leisure. In 2001, all Victorinox product categories (pocket tools, kitchen and professional knives, watches, bags and clothing) were finally gathered under one roof - in the largest store in Soho, New York. In 2005, Victorinox acquired its competitor Wenger, preventing its sale to foreign investors who could easily move production abroad. Thus, the company helped preserve hundreds more Swiss jobs and strengthened its position in the fight against Asian counterfeits. In 2006, Victorinox released an MP3 player called the Swiss Beat MP3 Player. Earlier, the company entered the digital technology market by releasing a knife with a built-in USB drive. Even earlier, consumers were offered a model with a laser pointer.</p><p> Together with Wenger, Victorinox produces about 26 million knives per year, exporting them to 150 countries around the world. The production of an army tool that is ideal for everyday use has become a strategically successful business choice for Victorinox, covering the male audience. And adapted branding abroad, segmentation and constant innovation turned out to be an excellent recipe for success that continues today.</p>"

            "content": "<h1>The Rise, Fall, and Revival of the Hilton Hotel Empire</h1><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><p> For decades, Hilton hotels were one of the symbols of the international hotel business. This group owned the most luxurious and prestigious hotels in New York, London, San Francisco, where celebrities and corporate leaders stayed. However, after reaching the peak of popularity in the 1960s, Hilton began to lose its influence. Due to financial difficulties, the company had to sell its hotel chain outside the US, and major competitors like Marriott and Sheraton forced it to give up its place at the top of the world hotel business. And yet, at the end of the century, thanks to a well-thought-out marketing policy, the corporation regained customer favor, proving that <b>Hilton hotels</b> are true to their principles and provide a unique level of service.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/hilton1.png\" alt=\"\"><br><br><h2 style=\"font-size: 36px;\">Together Again</h2><p> On the eve of the new 2006 year, news agencies around the world spread important news that changed the balance of power in the international hotel business. The American company Hilton Hotels Corporation announced the acquisition for $5.7 billion of the British Hilton Group, which owned a network of hotels, resorts and fitness clubs in almost 80 countries. Thus, the world's largest hotel company was created, which included about 2,800 hotels with 475,000 rooms. The two parts of the Hilton group, which split up in 1964, reunited after a 40-year hiatus. According to many experts, this deal was an important step towards restoring the company's former influence in the global hotel services market. However, the merger of the two \"Hiltons\" is not the beginning of a long road, but the final stage of an operation to revive the international brand.</p><br><br><h2 style=\"font-size: 36px;\">Hilton Founder</h2><img class=\"--image\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/conrad-hilton-gettyimages-514981198.jpg?resize=1200:*\" alt=\"\"><p> Conrad Hilton belongs to the generation of great entrepreneurs of the late 19th - early 20th centuries, who made America an economic superpower and turned American corporations into a world business elite. The son of a Norwegian immigrant, born in 1887, in 1919 he founded his business, spending the money he inherited from his father to buy a small hotel in Cisco, Texas. Resourceful, able to attract and ingratiate customers, Hilton quickly achieved prosperity and in 1926 opened a new hotel, naming it after himself. During the Great Depression, Conrad Hilton nearly went bankrupt, but managed to stay afloat and by 1934 already owned a network of five hotels in Texas. In 1938, he first went beyond his home state, acquiring the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco.</p><p> Conrad Hilton always strived to be first. He constantly built or acquired hotels, supplied them with his name sign and provided the highest, \"brand\" quality service. At the same time, under Hilton's leadership, he understood not only the continuous expansion of the business, but also the degree of its innovation. Throughout his life (he died at seventy-nine, living to be 91 years old), Conrad Hilton improved service standards, invented his own or applied already known progressive business management tools. So, in 1946, he was the first hotel owner to issue shares of his company on the stock exchange, thus obtaining funds for further expansion.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/hilton2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p> After World War II, the United States became the world leader, and American business began its triumphal march around the world. European countries, the Middle East, East Asia were flooded with American businessmen and tourists. Focusing on traveling Americans, in 1948 Conrad Hilton built his first hotel outside the United States in Mexico City. Global expansion began with the opening of the Hilton in Madrid in 1953. By the mid-1960s, the company had built 16 luxurious hotels in different countries around the world that were a true embodiment of America, a place where traveling Americans felt at home. At their service there were: English-speaking staff, hamburgers with fries and other \"delicacies\" of American cuisine, air conditioners and direct phones for international calls in the rooms. Hilton hotels were built in a deliberately modern style and stood out sharply against the backdrop of the ancient centers of Athens and Istanbul, Jerusalem and Cairo. Even in major Western European cities, they successfully played the role of symbols of American power and technical superiority. For example, the London Hilton became the first building in the city to exceed the height of St. Paul's Cathedral bell tower. At the same time, Conrad Hilton continued to expand in the United States. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> In the 1950s and early 1960s, he acquired several famous hotels, including the Mayflower in Washington, the Palmer House in Chicago, the Plaza and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. In addition, Hilton came up with the idea of airport hotels - the first such institution appeared in San Francisco in 1959. </span></p><p> The 1950s - early 1960s were the heyday of Hilton. However, the implemented projects required huge funds, and in the early 1960s the company's debts spiraled out of control. The group was on the verge of bankruptcy. Conrad Hilton had to make painful cuts. In 1964, he separated the international Hilton chain - the pride of the company, which brought it worldwide fame - by founding Hilton International and selling it to outside investors (though it was headed by Hilton's son Conrad Hilton Jr.). Subsequently, this company changed hands more than once until it was bought by Ladbrokes in 1987 - the largest British gambling syndicate, later renamed Hilton Group. And in 1966, the reins of power were assumed by his second son, William Barron Hilton. <br> <br> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> Recalling how accelerated expansion almost drowned the family business, he was the first among the owners of prestigious hotel chains to focus on franchising.</span> <br><br> By obliging the franchisee to maintain a guaranteed high level of service, provide guests with certain services and maintain the interior of the rooms at a level corresponding to established standards, the company, as a rule, built hotels with its own money, choosing locations for them, and then sold them to franchisees or leased them out. However, this activity gained wide scope only in the 90s, and until that time, the development of American Hilton was not so rapid. While the British Hilton Group, changing hands along the way, acquired a network of international resorts, health clubs and casinos, its relative structure in the US slowly expanded its franchise network and made targeted acquisitions. Nevertheless, the company remained true to its innovation strategy. In 1973, it implemented the first guest information system in the history of the global hotel industry - Hiltron, which allowed customers to remotely obtain information about room availability in its hotels and clubs and book them together with transportation tickets. The efficiency of the system was so high that it worked for 26 years and was only replaced in 1999 by the more modern Central Reservations System (CRS), or Hilstar. Unfortunately, innovative solutions had almost no impact on the company's profits. In 1990, it amounted to only $99 million with an annual income of $514 million, and 44% of earnings came from the Las Vegas Hilton and Flamingo Hilton located in the world capital of gambling. Of the more than 200 hotels owned by the company, over 125 were franchised. They operated under the Hilton Inn brand and were designed mainly for the middle class. Of course, the company's brand was still widely known in the world, but for the most part it was just a glimmer of past glory.</p><br><br><h2 style=\"font-size: 36px;\" >Bigger and Better</h2><p> The globalization of the world economy in the 1990s, accompanied at first by an economic upswing in the United States, awakened Hilton from its slumber. In 1996, the aging William Barron Hilton handed over the post of CEO to Stephen Bollenbach - an experienced manager who had previously held senior positions at Marriott and Disney. It was Bollenbach who set the company the ambitious goal of restoring Hilton's former fame and influence.</p><p> The first step towards Hilton's revival in the late 1990s was a whole series of acquisitions, which culminated in the $3.7 billion purchase of Promus Hotel Group in 1999. The latter owned more than 1,000 mid-range hotels under the Hampton Inn, DoubleTree, Embassy Suites and other brands. In addition, the construction of new hotels was sharply accelerated: in 2003-2004, the network expanded by 40-50 facilities per year due to this. Thanks to this activity, in 2005 the Hilton company already had about 2,300 hotels. However, Stephen Bollenbach's main focus was on a large-scale marketing campaign that was supposed to reaffirm Hilton's reputation.</p><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\"> Global Brand Trans form ation</p> <hr class=\"brief--hr\"></div> One of Stephen Bollenbach's first moves in this direction was the conclusion in January 1997 of a marketing agreement with the British Hilton Group. For the first time in 33 years, the two related companies entered into a close alliance, agreeing to jointly promote the common brand internationally and coordinate advertising campaigns. In 1998, the corporation conducted a series of marketing studies that revealed the expectations of Hilton guests, employees and business partners, as well as determined their perception of the brand. Hilton hotels were perceived as \"special places\" that very strongly reflected the culture of the country in which they were located. Based on the data obtained, a new Hilton brand concept was developed, combining the uniqueness of each hotel with uniform highest-level service standards. In addition, a single logo was created for both companies - a blue emblem with oval and spiral elements with a large letter H - which soon appeared in all Hilton hotels, both in the US and outside America.</p><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\"> Office and Lobby Trans form ation</p> <hr class=\"brief--hr\"></div> Minor but important changes were also made regarding hotel names: the word Hilton was put in first place almost everywhere. For example, Berlin Hilton became Hilton Berlin, and Long Beach Hilton changed its name to Hilton Long Beach. This rule was deviated from only if the \"non-Hilton\" name of the hotel was itself a strong local brand (for example, Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas or Cavalieri Hilton in Rome). However, simple changes in signage were naturally not the only thing done. Significant changes even occurred in the design of American Hilton's offices. Although guests were provided with high quality service and luxurious design, Hilton's corporate offices generally adhered to a Spartan style. However, management realized that it was completely inconsistent with the company's brand, which does business by giving guests a warm and welcoming reception. Over the course of six months (i.e. until the beginning of 1999), the lobbies of all Hilton corporate offices were rebuilt in accordance with the new standard. Visitors were greeted by a smiling concierge who amiably inquired about the purpose of their visit and then handed them a freshly made personal pass with an instant photo of the visitor. For important guests, the concierge, who had received advance notice, immediately addressed them by name and directed them to the right place without asking questions. Elements of the standard office interior were replaced by comfortable chairs and sofas reminiscent of Hilton hotel lobbies; the walls were decorated with pleasant warm-toned wallpaper (with splashes of corporate blue); information stands about the company appeared in corners. Two widescreen plasma televisions continuously showed beautifully filmed views of the hotels, while special guests could see one of the top managers greeting them directly on the screen. However, the main efforts were aimed at making a favorable impression on customers, primarily business travelers. And the main focus was on Hilton's mid-range hotels.</p><br><br><h2 style=\"font-size: 36px;\">For Those Who Wander</h2><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\">Revital izing Mid-Range Hotels</p></div> The mid-range hotel development program was launched back in 1997 when this category was represented in the company by the Hilton Garden Inn sub-brand. At that time, there were about a hundred such hotels. In 1999, when the purchase of Promus Hotel Group increased the number of such hotels several times over, the program was recognized as the top priority. Back in the late 1990s, conditions were created for business travelers in mid-range hotels - something like business centers equipped with IBM-compatible computers, fax machines, and Internet access, complemented by 24-hour food sales points, microwaves in rooms, and self-service laundries. At the beginning of the 21st century, a large-scale program was launched to change the image of institutions, which included 127 mandatory adjustments, 37 of which related to the interior of rooms. For the old price, clients were offered more luxury and additional services. At the same time, several major promotional campaigns were carried out. In particular, the Make It Hampton campaign launched in 2004 and costing $100 million was aimed at promoting the brand among business people. The approval of this large-scale program was preceded by a one-and-a-half-year preparatory period, during which the needs of guests were thoroughly researched. In particular, one of the results of the analysis was the development of special clocks that can be used as an alarm clock or radio and to which an MP3 player can be connected. These unique alarm clock radios, commissioned by Hampton from Timex, later played an important role in the advertising campaign to promote the new hotel format.</p><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\">Testing Boosts Satisf action</p></div> All the proposed changes underwent beta testing in about 100 hotels in 2003 (the Hampton network totaled 1,250 hotels in early 2004) and demonstrated high results, significantly increasing visitor satisfaction levels. This argument turned out to be crucial for franchisees who had to invest several hundred thousand dollars of their own funds in changing the design, upgrading beds and bathrooms (Hilton itself paid only $7.5 million a year to expand the breakfast menu, which could be taken away in packaged form). At the same time, a \"filtering\" program was introduced for franchisees: each Hampton network hotel must now undergo annual certification. According to Phil Cordell, about 40 hotels failed it in 2004, and franchising agreements with them were terminated.</p><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\">Expan ding Resort Offer ings</p></div> The British Hilton Group also paid attention to the development of sub-brands - in this case, the Hilton Worldwide Resorts international resort chain. In 2002, when a campaign was launched to promote this brand, the Hilton Group network included 34 resort centers, and by the end of 2005 their number was planned to increase to 59. This decision was made based on research showing that customers who spend the most money during vacations find resorts in exotic locations most attractive. An analysis of consumer survey data also showed that the needs of this customer group go beyond the usual set of services and entertainment offered at resorts, so more comprehensive guest satisfaction required retraining staff. This task was complicated by the fact that the employees of resort centers represented different countries and cultures. In addition, wealthy visitors who love to vacation in different corners of the globe value diversity, fresh impressions and do not tolerate a standardized approach. In this regard, the project team headed by development director Philippa Gould and senior vice president of marketing Mike Ashton faced the very non-trivial problem of raising the level of service for the entire network while preserving as much individuality as possible for each resort center.</p><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\">Enha ncing Resort Experi ence</p></div> The program provided for a preparatory stage lasting one and a half years, during which model \"sponsor\" hotels were selected to become examples and bases for testing individual elements of the new concept. New features were tested on them: children's entertainment centers, dining facilities, including buffets for children, forms of welcoming and seeing off guests, etc. Based on these developments, general recommendations, video and methodological materials were prepared, seminars and trainings were conducted, while only basic concepts were worked out, which, within individual resort centers, were to be filled with unique content, whether it be diving, romantic evenings, or hot mineral springs. Employees were given general guidelines, but then they had to use their creativity and imagination, which meant departing from the traditional Hilton concept whereby guests were to receive the same service in any corner of the globe. Most of the financial resources allocated for the program implementation were spent on staff training and the development of original projects, while the advertising budget turned out to be very limited. In this regard, the marketing campaign was targeted in nature and focused mainly on travel agencies, which accounted for about 60% of Hilton Worldwide Resorts' business.</p><p><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left;\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px\">Promo ting Hilton Resorts</p></div> A series of presentations was held for tour operators, information about new services at Hilton resorts was placed in specialized publications intended for the tourism industry, and a number of selected travel agency representatives were able to personally familiarize themselves with the new features. The company participated in major industry exhibitions but did not set up its own stands, instead holding presentations that allowed visitors to gain a fuller understanding of the product. With regard to end users, the main emphasis was on encouraging repeat trips. Hilton corporate TV channels broadcasting programs that talked about other network resorts were aired in the rooms of resort hotels. Clients who had once vacationed at Hilton Worldwide Resorts received mailings by regular and email with promotional brochures and information about special offers.</p><p> <b> This policy proved successful. In 2003, a year after the launch of the program, the unit's revenues grew by 8%, while the industry as a whole experienced a 5% decline. </b></p><br><br><h2 style=\"font-size: 36px;\">The Foot of the Summit</h2><p> However, Hilton's successes in promoting sub-brands were to some extent devalued by the fact that the main brand lagged behind. As Hilton President and Chief Operating Officer Matt Hart self-critically noted, the obsession with mid-range hotelsb <b style=\"font-size: 24px;\" > \"put the Hilton brand itself, which was not getting proper attention, in a risky position.\"</b> <br> Of course, it cannot be said that the company did not engage in its core business at all in the early 21st century (after acquiring Promus, over 60% of the company's profit came from mid-range hotels). In 2002-2003, as usual, Hilton slowly and methodically developed a new image that would best meet the desires and perceptions of the target audience. The result of this research was a series of commercials that appeared in 2004. According to Robert Dirks, Hilton's Senior Vice President of Brand Management, the campaign slogan <b style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> “Take Me to The Hilton”</b> means the following: take me to a heavenly place where no one can find me and where I can really relax. Business travelers were offered a slightly different idea: <b> Hilton is a hotel where every guest is treated specially, but at the same time their privacy is respected.</b></p><p> According to Hilton management, the problem was that the hotels no longer matched their star image. To solve it, in mid-2005 the company approved a three-year $500 million program to renovate about 240 Hilton hotels in the US. It is expected that about 50 of them will be sold to new owners, about 70-80 will be put into operation by the end of 2006, and more than 100 will undergo major renovations, after which they will offer guests a new service program, new beds and bathroom interiors, as well as improved telephone, mobile and Internet connectivity. <br> <br> <b style=\"font-size: 34px;\"> “Our concept is to make guests feel as comfortable as at home,”</b> says Jeff Diskin, Senior Vice President of Brand Management. In its marketing policy, Hilton, as in the best of times, relies on repeat visitors. The company proceeds from the premise that a satisfied client who liked living in its hotel will return to it more than once. The corporate loyalty program Hilton HHonors Worldwide, which now covers all the company's hotel chains, also serves this purpose.</p><p> In the opinion of many experts, the merger at the end of 2005 of the American and British \"branches\" will help strengthen the Hilton brand. The British managers, who preserved the traditions of Hilton's luxurious international hotels, gained access to the resources of the American corporation and got rid of non-core gambling assets. Obviously, in the coming years, a new wave of Hilton expansion in Europe can be expected, where, according to experts, no more than 20% of hotels belong to any chains, and the remaining 80% exist on their own and are unlikely to be able to oppose anything to the aggressive onslaught of an established international brand.</p>"

Richard Thaler, an expert in behavioral economics, met Michael Cobb, the brother of one of his students, and together they developed innovative solutions based on an understanding of consumer behavior.</p><br><br><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/greek-peak-1.png\" alt=\"\"><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left; \"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 24px; text-align: left; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', serif;\"> Skiing Business Dilemma</p></div><p>The story begins with Richard Thaler meeting David Cobb at Cornell University, who then introduced him to his brother Michael. Michael, growing up in Ithaca, had a passion for skiing and worked as the marketing director in the family-owned company \"Greek Peak,\" located nearby. At that time, Greek Peak faced serious financial difficulties due to consecutive seasons of insufficient snowfall and an economic crisis. The company had to take loans with high interest rates to survive until the start of the new season. In such a situation, Michael needed help, and he proposed a barter deal to Richard Thaler: lift tickets and equipment for him and his children in exchange for assistance in overcoming the company's financial troubles.</p><p>It soon became evident that to overcome the crisis, Greek Peak needed to raise its service prices. However, increasing prices posed the risk of losing customers since the resort couldn't compete with larger resorts in Vermont and New Hampshire in terms of scale and size. Operational costs per customer were comparable to larger competitors, but Greek Peak only had five lifts and smaller slopes. How could they justify raising prices without losing customers, especially among students from Cornell and nearby colleges?</p><p>From the perspective of behavioral economics, Greek Peak's customers assessed the lift ticket prices by comparing them to those at popular resorts in Vermont. Due to Greek Peak's smaller size, customers expected prices to be significantly lower here. However, the resort's main advantage was its accessibility. Greek Peak was the closest skiing destination in the central part of New York state, making it attractive to local residents and those coming from southern regions such as Scranton, Philadelphia, and Washington. Buses filled with skiers from these places arrived daily at Greek Peak.</p><p>Even if these innovations somewhat justified the higher lift prices, there was still the question of how to deal with the local market, sensitive to price changes. In this regard, we had a ready-made model to work with. For \"Greek Peak\" University students, we offered a pass for six weekday tickets at a substantial discount if purchased before October 15. These passes sold well and served as a source of quick profit. I suspect students liked the offer not only for its cost-effectiveness but also because it was called \"six in one.\" Even an implicit hint at beer always resonated with the hearts of students.</p><br> <br><div style=\"width: 120px; float: left; text-align: center\"><p style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 29px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', serif;\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 900; font-size: 80px; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', serif;\"> 10 </span> <br> in one</p></div><p>We pondered whether we could offer something similar for local customers outside the student environment. Our goal was to develop an offer specifically for those living in our town, unavailable to those who only came to ski once or twice a year. For visiting skiers, the lift ticket price was a small part of the overall costs, including transportation, food, and accommodation. For them, a slight price increase wouldn't likely change the decision to go skiing, especially considering the lack of alternatives nearby. Eventually, we came up with the \"10 in one\" pass. It included five weekend tickets and five weekday tickets, priced 40% cheaper than the regular retail price if purchased before October 15.</p><p>The \"10 in one\" offer enjoyed tremendous demand among the local population due to several behavioral factors. The first one is obvious: a 40% discount seems like a very lucrative deal, offering a lot of transactional utility. Secondly, purchasing in advance separates the decision to pay from the decision to consume the service, i.e., skiing. Similar to the wine example, the initial purchase is seen as an \"investment\" that saves money, allowing for the spontaneous decision to ski on a sunny Sunday after fresh snowfall without additional costs. The fact that someone could have chosen to dine out instead of skiing on the previous weekend doesn't register as a loss in mental accounting because the skiing was \"free.\" For the resort, the missed skiing wasn't just free; it turned into irreversible costs. As the season approached its end, skiers were more eager to use their tickets to avoid losing the money invested in the \"10 in one\" pass. Additionally, each of them could bring a friend along, who had to pay the full price (tickets couldn't be transferred to others).</p><section><div class=\"card-large\"><a href=\"/pages/marketing/marketing.php\"><h2> How to make marketing project</h2></a><span class=\"--gray\">By Danylo Khorzhevskyi | 02.01.2022</span><p style=\"font-size: 1ppx;\"><img img style=\"width: 180px; float:left; margin-right:  20px; padding-bottom: 0px \" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/greek-peak-5.png\" alt=\"\"><br> A marketing project involves the initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure of marketing-related activities and deliverables. It encompasses the coordination of teams to meet customer needs and achieve marketing goals.</p></div></section><p>The team pondered whether they could offer something similar for local residents living in the town who didn't plan to ski often. For visitors coming from afar, the lift ticket cost was just a small part of the overall expenses, including transportation, food, and accommodation. A slight price increase wouldn't likely affect their decision to visit, given the absence of alternative resorts nearby. As a result, the team developed the \"10 in one\" pass, which included five weekend tickets and five weekday tickets, providing a 40% discount if purchased before October 15.</p><p>The \"10 in one\" offer quickly became popular among local residents, and this was due to several behavioral factors. Firstly, the 40% discount looked like a very lucrative deal, attracting buyers. It provided significant transactional utility. Secondly, the opportunity to purchase the pass in advance separated the payment decision from the consumption decision over time. The purchase was seen as an \"investment,\" saving money and providing flexibility in planning skiing trips. Additionally, missed skiing opportunities were considered sunk costs, encouraging customers to use their tickets closer to the end of the season. Thus, the \"10 in one\" offer attracted local residents and contributed to an increase in the resort's attendance.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/greek-peak-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>The \"10 in one\" offer was also popular because skiing is one of those activities we always plan to dedicate more time to in the coming year. \"Last year, I only made it to the mountains three times; it's ridiculous considering how close 'Greek Peak' is. This year, I plan to take a few weekends and go skiing when it's less crowded.\" Similar to purchasing a gym membership to motivate oneself to exercise more, the identity of being a skiing enthusiast supported the idea of planning more skiing weekends in winter. The \"10 in one\" offer was an excellent way not only to incorporate skiing into one's schedule but also to save money.</p><p>A few years later, the \"6 in one,\" \"10 in one,\" and seasonal passes constituted a significant portion of the resort's revenue. This income arrived quickly, relieving the management from the need to take loans to stay afloat until the start of a new season in December. Selling tickets in advance also protected against losses associated with warm, snowless winters. Although ski resorts can make snow, the air temperature must be low enough for the snow generators to operate. Furthermore, and this baffles ski resort owners, even if it's cold enough but there's no snow on the ground in town, people are much less likely to think about going skiing, even if the resort has all the conditions for it.</p><p>Three years after the launch of the \"10 in one\" sales, Michael did the calculations and called me to report the results. Remember, this pass was sold for only 60% of the full cost of 10 tickets. \"Guess how many tickets were used?\" Michael asked. \"Sixty percent!\" \"Greek Peak\" sold tickets for 60% of the retail price, but only 60% of the tickets purchased this way were used. It's like selling tickets at full price but getting the money several months in advance: a tremendous benefit.</p><p>Such a result seemed not to disappoint customers, most of whom bought the \"10 in one\" pass again the next year. Even those who didn't use all their tickets blamed themselves rather than the resort. Of course, there were those who didn't use almost any of the pre-purchased tickets by the end of the season. Some asked if they could use these tickets next year. They were politely informed that these tickets were meant for use only in the current year. However, Eli came up with a special offer for such customers. If they bought another \"10 in one\" pass for the next year, the validity of unused tickets was extended. While the person who managed to go skiing only 2 or 3 times last year probably wouldn't ski more than 10 times this year, the offer still looked attractive. Although I don't think there were many fools who bought another pass just to extend the validity of unused tickets, these customers liked that the resort management was accommodating and trying to restore \"justice,\" which, as we'll soon discover, can be a crucial way to maintain customer loyalty.</p><p>The \"10 in one\" offer turned out to be popular among local residents as well, and this can be explained by another behavioral factor. Skiing is often perceived as an activity we promise to dedicate more time to in the coming year. Many people might say to themselves, \"Last year, I went to the mountains only three times, which is strange considering the proximity of 'Greek Peak.' This year, I intend to spend more weekends and go skiing, especially when the resort is less crowded.\" Similar to the situation with a gym membership where you plan to devote more time to physical activity, the identity of being a skiing enthusiast stimulated the idea of planning more skiing weekends in winter. The \"10 in one\" offer became an excellent way not only to incorporate skiing into plans but also to save money.</p><p>A few years later, the \"6 in one,\" \"10 in one,\" and seasonal passes became a significant part of the resort's revenue. This income arrived quickly, relieving the management from the need to take loans to stay afloat until the start of a new season in December. Selling tickets in advance also protected the resort from losses associated with warm winters with little snow. Although ski resorts can make artificial snow, the air temperature must be low enough for the snow generators to operate. Furthermore, and this baffles ski resort owners, even if it's cold enough but there's no snow on the ground in town, people are much less likely to think about going skiing, even if the resort has all the conditions for it.</p><p><b style=\"  font-size: 36px; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', serif;\"> \"Receiving revenue in advance—insurance against uncertainty, ensuring financial stability and independence from natural factors for the resort.\" </b></p><p>Three years after the launch of the \"10 in one\" pass, Michael did the calculations and shared the results with Richard Thaler. Remember, this pass was sold for only 60% of the full cost of 10 tickets. Michael asked the question, \"Guess how many tickets were used?\" And the answer was, \"Sixty percent!\" In other words, \"Greek Peak\" sold discounted tickets, but ultimately, 60% of the purchased tickets were used. This effectively meant that the resort was selling tickets at full price but receiving money for them in advance. It was a tremendous win.</p><p>It's amazing that such a result didn't disappoint customers. Many of them were buying the \"10 in one\" pass again for the next year. Even those who didn't use all their tickets blamed themselves rather than the resort. Certainly, there were those who didn't use almost any of the pre-purchased tickets by the end of the season. Some customers asked if unused tickets could be used next year. And while the answer was \"no,\" \"Greek Peak\" offered a special condition for such customers. If they bought another \"10 in one\" pass for the next year, the validity of unused tickets was extended. Although few of them might have taken advantage of this opportunity, this offer fostered a positive perception of the resort and contributed to strengthening customer loyalty.</p><p>The last pricing challenge \"Greek Peak\" had to tackle concerned the start of the season when, after the first snowfall, the resort opened, but only one lift was operational. Enthusiastic skiers eagerly awaited the opening since the last March and would definitely show up in the first days. What fee should be charged from them? Usually, Eli would peek out the window, assess the weather, and then inform the cashiers of the price, often giving a 50% discount from the regular rate. Of course, most skiers who came on that day had no idea what the price would be; they only knew the regular rate. Only the most meticulous could decipher Eli's pricing strategy at the beginning of the season. I call this a \"secret sale.\" The customer approaches the counter, ready to pay the regular price, when suddenly they are told, \"Today we have a 50% discount.\" This might contribute to increased loyalty, but on the other hand, such pricing strategy is far from the best because the buyer was already willing to pay the full price. Lowering the price makes sense only when it helps boost current sales or possibly future sales by maintaining customer loyalty.</p><p><b style=\"  font-size: 36px; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', serif;\"> \"Coupons and discounts: not just a purchase incentive but also a tool for building customer loyalty.\" </b></p><p>Michael and I came up with a new strategy. At the beginning of the season, or in our case, at any point in the season when only part of the mountain is open for skiing, the price is set by this formula. The skier pays the full price to ski on that day but receives a 50% discount coupon for the next visit, depending on how many lifts are operational. Since customers were prepared to pay the full price, this offer seemed quite generous to them, and the coupon could serve as an incentive to come again sooner or perhaps buy lunch and beer.</p><p>Once, Michael told me a story that showed how popular these coupons were. One customer came to ski for the first time this season and bought a new \"10 in one\" pass. He's in line to get the lift ticket with this pass and suddenly hears the cashier explaining to the girl in front of him in line that she will get a 50% discount coupon, which she can use on her next visit. Our hero likes this offer so much that he hides his pass in his pocket and takes out money for a full-price single-day ticket. I've always been curious whether he used that coupon before his pass expired. We'll never know.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/greek-peak-4.png\" alt=\"\"><p>But we know for sure that creating a sustainable revenue base before the start of the season allowed the resort to achieve its goals, get out of financial troubles, and reduce dependence on snowfall during the winter.

            "content": "<h1> Marketing Insight: Kahneman's and Barden's Dual System Theories</h1><br><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><h2> Dual System Theory <br>of Daniel Kahneman <br> and Phil Barden</h2><p>I have always been interested in how the human mind works and what drives our behavior. That's why I recently became fascinated with reading books on marketing and psychology.</p><p>I was especially captivated by the work of Daniel Kahneman and Phil Barden. In his book \"Thinking Fast and Slow,\" Kahneman describes two systems of thinking - the intuitive System 1 and the logical System 2. And in \"Decoded: The Science Behind Why We Buy,\" Barden talks about the \"pilot\" and the \"autopilot.\"</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/Dual-System-Theories-1.png\" alt=\"\"><p>I realized these are essentially the same thing. The autopilot is our instincts and emotions, while the pilot is logical thinking. Interestingly, they work in tandem.</p><p>For example, when I walk through a supermarket, my gaze first catches on a bright package or appetizing smell - that's the autopilot at work. But then the pilot kicks in and starts analyzing - is it worth buying this product, is it too expensive?</p><p>The same happens with brands. When I see the Starbucks logo, the autopilot immediately elicits positive emotions - aromatic coffee, cozy atmosphere. And the pilot then decides if I'm willing to overpay for the brand.</p><p>Understanding how these two systems operate is a key point in marketing. Companies try to create an attractive \"framing\" for the product to appeal to our autopilot. But it's also important to logically convince the pilot that the purchase makes sense.</p><br><br><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><h2>The <br> Systems <br> of <br> Thinking <br> in Action</h2><p>System 1, or the \"autopilot,\" represents our intuitive reaction to the outside world. It quickly makes judgments and perceives external factors like product design or store atmosphere. This process happens instantly and subconsciously, and we often don't even realize it.</p><p>System 2, or the \"pilot,\" represents a more conscious, analytical approach. This system requires effort and concentration. The pilot analyzes specific product characteristics, makes comparisons, and evaluates them.</p><p>It's important to understand these two systems don't act independently of each other. They interact and influence our decisions. For example, when choosing a product in a store, the autopilot may draw our attention to an attractive package or aroma, while the pilot will analyze the price and quality.</p><p>In marketing and advertising, understanding this interaction can be key. Knowing how both systems influence consumer decisions, marketers can create effective strategies that appeal to both the intuitive and rational sides of consumers.</p><br><br><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><h2>The <br> Framing Effect <br> and <br> Brand Influence</h2><p>The \"framing\" effect is a phenomenon Phil Barden describes in detail in his book \"Decoded: The Science Behind Why We Buy.\" It refers to how external factors and context influence the perception of a product or service.</p><p>Imagine you are in a supermarket aisle facing the coffee section. One coffee tin stands out with stylish packaging and is under bright lighting. Another tin has modest branding and sits in a less lit corner. This is the framing effect – the surroundings and design influence your perception of the product.</p><p>Now imagine one tin belongs to a famous brand like Starbucks, while the other is from a local cafe without a well-known name. Regardless of the actual coffee quality, the Starbucks brand creates a sort of \"framing\" for its product.</p><img class=\"--image\" src=\"/images/pictures/blog/Dual-System-Theories-2.png\" alt=\"\"><p>The Starbucks brand is associated with the atmosphere of cozy cafes, stylish design, and high quality. So many consumers are willing to overpay for Starbucks coffee, even when a similar coffee at a local cafe costs less.</p><p>This example shows how a brand can create \"framing\" that appeals to the consumer's System 1 or autopilot. The emotions and associations tied to the brand can alter the perception of the product and influence the purchase decision.</p><p>For marketers, this means brand-building and creating positive associations can be a powerful tool for influencing consumer behavior. Understanding how brand interacts with System 1 allows developing marketing strategies that account for this \"framing\" effect.</p><p>Thus, the framing effect and influence of brand can significantly impact consumer decision making.</p><br><br><hr class=\"brief--hr\"><h2>Interaction Between <br> the Pilot and Autopilot <br> in Marketing</h2><p>We've already looked at the two systems of thinking - the \"pilot\" and the \"autopilot\" - and how they influence consumer decision making. Now let's discuss how these systems interact in a marketing context.</p><p>The pilot is the conscious system that analyzes specific product characteristics like price, quality, utility. The pilot is similar to System 2 described in Daniel Kahneman's \"Thinking Fast and Slow.\" It's the effortful, aware system.</p><p>The autopilot is the intuitive system that instantly reacts to external factors and creates \"framing\" around the product. This can be packaging design, store atmosphere, music, scents, and other stimuli. The autopilot is akin to Kahneman's System 1 – the fast, emotional system.</p><p>It's important to understand the pilot and autopilot work closely together when making purchase decisions. Imagine you are standing in front of a shelf with a product, and your gaze falls on it. At this moment, your autopilot starts evaluating the \"framing\" - the design, color, brand associations. Emotions and first impressions are formed quickly and subconsciously.</p><p>Then your pilot kicks in. You start analyzing the price, quality, usefulness of the product. The pilot requires effort and concentration, and at this point you may ask yourself questions like \"Do I really need this?\" or \"Can I find a better deal?\"</p><p>The final purchase decision is shaped at the intersection of the pilot and autopilot's work. If the \"framing\" elicits positive emotions and associations, the pilot is inclined to confirm the choice. But if the pilot finds downsides like a high price, it may object.</p><p>For marketers and brands, it's important to understand this interaction. Creating positive \"framing\" around a product, backed up by conscious arguments, can significantly increase purchase likelihood. Brand strength and external design can convince the autopilot of the right choice, while price and product characteristics convince the pilot.</p><p>In marketing, it's crucial to work with both consumer thinking systems, accounting for their interplay. This allows creating the best conditions for a successful sale.</p><br><br><span class=\"--gray\"><p><b> Source:</b> \"Decoded: The Science Behind Why We Buy\" by Phil Barden; Thinking, Fast and Slow is a 2011 popular science book by psychologist Daniel Kahneman</p></span>"
